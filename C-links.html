RFC: C-level Links Between Packages
</h1>

This RFC was originallly sent to R-core on 8 January 2006.  Lightly
edited for subsequent changes, in particular for direct linking to
Windows DLLs.


<p><p>
This has been raised from time to time (e.g. lmer and Matrix), and I've been
putting some thoughts together in the hope we can get a way forward
implemented for 2.4.0.

<p>
Suppose package B's DLL wants to link to code provided by package A, say Aex
(which might be A's DLL or some other code).  I'm assuming that A is
advertising this feature and that there are no loops (we cannot load a set
of packages with a dependency loop now).

<p>
A related scenario is Windows packages which want to link to external
code, e.g. to GSL.  The thing which makes Windows special is that
commonly users have no permission to install in the system library
(something like <tt>C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32</tt>) so such code has to be put
elsewhere.  This could occur on Unix-alikes too, but we tend to
statically load such code.

<h2>Windows</h2>

Linking to another DLL is essentially controlled by the PATH, and that can
be altered in a running process.  So for our scenario, B.dll is link-edited
against Aex.dll.  Then we have choices:

<p>
(Wa) When package A is loaded, it appends its libs directory to the path, to
make Aex.dll available to all packages loaded subsequently.

<p>
(Wb) When package B is loaded, it temporarily adds A/libs to the path (it
will know where to look as package A will be already loaded). [My preference.]

<p>
(Wc) The problem with Wa is that the path has a length limit which is
imprecisely documented and depends on the Windows version: it might be 262
chars.  So we could install the `exporting' DLLs into a fixed place in the
library tree, and change the path when we change library trees.

<h2>Solaris-alikes</h2>


that is, using a dlopen interface modelled on Solaris, such as that in POSIX
(but Solaris itself goes further).  How dependencies are resolved in dlopen
is not described on the POSIX or Linux help pages, but it is described on
Solaris.  I don't know or care about AIX, but guess it needs export
files.  [Update for 2.4.0: it should work in a more standard way with
run-time linking.]

<p>
Here we have several choices.

<p>
(Sa)  Package A provides a static library for package B to link against.
(We may need to augment INSTALL to be able to find package A, especially if
we allow it to be in another library than the one B is being installed
into.)

<p>
(Sb)  Package A arranges to dlopen Aex.so with RTLD_GLOBAL, to make its
symbols available for subsquent loads.  Package B needs to do no more than
load A first.

<p>
(Sc)  Package A links against Aex.so.  Then at runtime, Aex.so has to be
found.

<p>
(Sc1) LD_LIBRARY_PATH is used: this needs Aex.so to be linked to a place on
LD_LIBRARY_PATH, which is only consulted once (it is not clear exactly when,
but I guess at or before the first use of dlopen).  I think DTL once
suggested having a location on a per-library basis, but libraries can be
added dynamically.  So I think this would need the R front-end to allocate a
place and add it to LD_LIBRARY_PATH, and then for library() to arrange to
link Aex.so into that place.  In this scenario B.so is link-edited to Aex.so
(e.g. via -lAex, no path).  (This is tricky for embedded uses unless the
executable can set LD_LIBRARY_PATH, but that may be problem already.)

<p>
(Sc2)  B.so is link-edited to /path/to/Aex.so, perhaps a relative path.
An absolute path will work if the R installation is not subsequently to be
moved (e.g. installed).  A relative path would work if we make use of links
as we do for HTML help.  On at least some systems it is possible to use an
absolute path, and edit it in B.so prior to loading. [My preference,
using relative paths.]


<h2>MacOS X/Darwin</h2>

Sorry, not much idea (are they even the same?)  For example

<p>
<a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man3/dlopen.3.html"><tt>http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man3/dlopen.3.html</tt></a>

<p>
describes dlopen, but not how linking is done (and there is the .so/.dylib
difference to consider).  My guess is that one needs Aex.dylib on
DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH or link-edited via a path.

<h2>R Interface</h2>


The biggest problem I see is resolving/avoiding symbol conflicts (and
possibly even DLL name conflicts).  For that reason I prefer (Wb) and (Sc,
probably Sc2).

<p>
This would need an R interface along the lines of

<pre>
        dyn.load(x, local = TRUE, now = TRUE, LinkingTo = "B")
</pre>

<p>
and similarly for useDynlib (library.dynam already has a ... arg).  We could
incorporate the Windows' need to supply other DLLs by allowing a package to
link to itself (".").  This is also necessary if package A wants its DLL
linked to Aex (and to accommodate darwin, one may need to go that route).

<p>
Package B would need to say it needs access to package A so INSTALL can
arrange suitable (include and library) paths.  I suggest this is done by a
LinkingTo:  entry in DESCRIPTION.

<p>
Finally, package A needs to advertise its facilities and create
Aex.dll, Aex.so, Aex.dylib ....  I would leave that to
A/src/Makefile[.win].  After a lot of experience, we might want to
provide some canned facilities.  We also need some conventions.  It
seems best if headers are installed into A/include, and DSOs, dylibs,
import libraries into A/libs.  (I've often mused as to why a directory
containing one file has a plural name, so let's make use of that.)
