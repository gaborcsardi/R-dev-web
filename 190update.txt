Updating packages for 1.9.0
===========================

Package maintainers should be aware of the following changes scheduled
to appear in 1.9.0.

1) Package checking `` for code/documentation mismatches ''
   now gives more   `` Codoc mismatches from documentation object ... '' :

   The default for codoc() {in package tools} has been changed to
   `use.values = NULL' (from `use.values = FALSE') since we found that in
   almost all places such documentation mismatches are accidental and can
   be misleading.

   In the \usage{ } section, you should usually specify the default values
   of arguments exactly as they are in the R code.
   If a default value is too complicated, you must specify it at all.
   We recommend to use  `arg = ' (with an empty right hand side but an
   extra "="), because this still suggests that the code has an explicit
   default value.

2) The `package' argument to data() is no longer allowed to be an
   unquoted name, i.e., you must use
   data(state, package = "base")  instead of
   data(state, package = base).

3) R CMD check now runs the (Rd)examples with default RNGkind (uniform & normal)
   and set.seed(1).  This may change output of your examples.
   Note that  example(*, setRNG = TRUE) uses the same RNG setup.
