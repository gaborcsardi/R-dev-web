Updating packages for 1.9.0
===========================

Package maintainers should be aware of the following changes scheduled
to appear in 1.9.0.

x
1) Package checking `` for code/documentation mismatches ''
   now gives more   `` Codoc mismatches from documentation object ... '' :

   The default for codoc() {in package tools} has been changed to
   `use.values = NULL' (from `use.values = FALSE') since we found that in
   almost all places such documentation mismatches are accidental and can
   be misleading.

   In the \usage{ } section, you should usually specify the default
   values of arguments exactly as they are in the R code.  If a
   default value is too complicated, you should not specify it at all.
   We recommend using `arg = ' (with an empty right hand side but with
   "="), because this still suggests that the code has an explicit
   default value.

2) The `package' argument to data() is no longer allowed to be an
   unquoted name, e.g., you must use
   data(state, package = "base")  instead of
   data(state, package = base).

3) R CMD check now runs the (Rd)examples with default RNGkind (uniform
   & normal) and set.seed(1).  This may change output of your
   examples.  Note that example(*, setRNG = TRUE) uses the same RNG
   setup.

4) When model.frame is called, it adds to its terms attribute an
   attribute "dataClasses", and this can be checked against the
   newdata argument by a call to .checkMFClasses: see lm and
   predict.lm for how to do so.  Developers who use predict(newdata=)
   may wish to add such code to their packages.  (You can use

        if (!is.null(cl <- attr(Terms, "dataClasses")) &&
            exists(".checkMFClasses", envir=NULL))
            .checkMFClasses(cl, m)

  to be backwards compatible.)  If your code is like rpart and handles
  ordered and unordered factors differently use .checkMFClasses(cl, m,
  TRUE) --- this is not needed for code like lm as both the set of
  levels of the factors and the contrasts used at fit time are
  recorded in the fit object and retrieved by the predict methods.
