Data editor thoughts (or incoherent ramblings...):

- get something working quickly. Refine later. Not sure using an
  existing spreadsheet program really "cuts it". I *don't* think we
  want a "view" model!

 Data structure: list of columns. Display side by side in grid. 
		 possible data types: numeric, character, factor.

		 factor types require add'l information on valid
		 values + maybe a way of switching between input and
		 output representations.

		 Generic vectors? Loose idea: arbitrary field types
		 handled by popping up secondary worksheets. (might
		 allow variable-length recordings inside individual
		 records).

 Superstructure: grouped columns -> matrices, data frames, lists.
                 displayed using multi-line headings. How about things
                 like Surv() objects? Arrays might get messy.

 Attributes? (AsIs, time series)
 
 Coercion (use callbacks into R?) Note that changing one matrix column
 changes all of them...

 Cell names??

 Exact API for the whole slew needs to be defined relatively early, so
 that portable versions can be defined (X11/Windows/WXWindows/Tk...).

Plan:

1) Basic editor with simple columns. Roughly "as is". Needs factor
   specification issues, block deletions/insertions, change cell to NA
   (currently tricky), misc. userfriendliness... Handle
   dataframes/matrices via dispatching. (fix(data) might be an idea.
   fix(data.frame()) to create a new one)

2) Add superstructure and attribute capabilities. Possibly also the
   "generic field" capability (suspect to need it for the attributes
   anyway).

3) Bells + whistles...
