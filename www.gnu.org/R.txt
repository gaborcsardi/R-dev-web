%%name: R

%%short-description: Statistical computation and graphics

%%full-description: An environment for statistical computing and
graphics based on the S programming language from Bell Labs.  The
program provides a wide variety of statistical and graphical techniques
(linear and non-linear modelling, statistical tests, time series
analysis, classification, clustering, etc.).

<p>R is designed as a true computer language with control-flow
constructions for iteration and alternation, and it lets users add
additional functionality by defining new functions. For
computationally intensive tasks, Fortran and C code can be called and
linked at run time.
