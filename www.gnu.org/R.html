`GNU S' - A language and environment for statistical computing and
graphics. R is similar to S, which was developed at Bell Laboratories
by John Chambers et al. It provides a wide variety of statistical and
graphical techniques (linear and nonlinear modelling, statistical
tests, time series analysis, classification, clustering, ...).

R is designed as a true computer language with control-flow
constructions for iteration and alternation, and it allows users to
add additional functionality by defining new functions. For
computationally intensive tasks, C and Fortran code can be linked and
called at run time.

<H4><A NAME="environment" HREF="#TOCenvironment">The R environment</A></H4>

<P>
R is an integrated suite of software facilities for data
manipulation, calculation and graphical display.  Among other things it
has

<UL>
<LI>an effective data handling and storage facility,
<LI>a suite of operators for calculations on arrays, in particular matrices,
<LI>a large, coherent, integrated collection of intermediate tools for data
analysis,
<LI>graphical facilities for data analysis and display either directly at
the computer or on hardcopy, and
<LI>a well developed, simple and effective programming language which
includes conditionals, loops, user defined recursive functions and input
and output facilities.  (Indeed most of the system supplied functions
are themselves written in the S language.)
</UL>

<P>
The term "environment" is intended to characterize it as a fully
planned and coherent system, rather than an incremental accretion of
very specific and inflexible tools, as is frequently the case with other
data analysis software.

<P>
R is very much a vehicle for newly developing methods of interactive
data analysis.  As such it is very dynamic, and new releases have not
always been fully backwards compatible with previous releases.  Some
users welcome the changes because of the bonus of new technology and new
methods that come with new releases; others seem to be more worried by
the fact that old code no longer works.  Although R is intended as a
programming language, one should regard most programs written in R as
essentially ephemeral.

<P>
Our introduction to the R environment did not mention
<EM>statistics</EM>, yet many people use R as a statistics system.  We
prefer to think of it of an environment within which many classical and
modern statistical techniques have been implemented.  Some of these are
built into the base R environment, but many are supplied as
<EM>packages</EM>. (Currently the distinction is largely a matter of
historical accident.)  There are about 8 packages supplied with R
(called "standard" packages) and many more are available through the
CRAN family of Internet sites (see below).
