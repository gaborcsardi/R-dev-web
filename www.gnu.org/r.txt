%%name: R

%%short-description: Statistical computation and graphics.

%%full-description: A dialect of the S programming language from Bell
Labs. The program provides a wide variety of statistical and graphical
techniques (linear and non-linear modelling, statistical tests, time
series analysis, classification, clustering, etc.). 

R is designed as a true computer language with control-flow
constructions for iteration and alternation, and it lets users add
additional functionality by defining new functions. For
computationally intensive tasks, Fortran and C code can be called and
linked at run time.
