Grid Graphics:  An R package of "alternative" graphical functions, the 
main aim of which is to provide graphical support for being able to 
produce Trellis-like graphics.
    <ul>
    <li>
    My not-set-in-concrete-but-to-give-some-idea plan is to release 
    a 0.2 version of grid (still as a package "under development")
    in early September 2001.  The hope is to have it
    ready for release as a "real" package in time for the release of
    R 1.4 (end of 2001?) so that Deepayan has a chance to have 
    lattice complete enought for Doug Bates to make nlme 
    depend on lattice.
    </ul>
<li> 
Lattice Graphics:  Use the Grid Graphics package
to replicate as much as possible 
of Trellis.  NOTE that Bill Cleveland has pointed out (and the 
Trademark Electronic Search System will back him up if necessary) that neither
"Trellis" nor "Trellis Graphics" are registered trademarks (for a
statistical graphics application).  One of Doug Bates' students,
Deepayan Sarkar, has taken this on and produced heaps
of the functionality already.
<li>
Implement the "density" and "angle" arguments of polygon() as per S-Plus.
<li>
Attack the long list of graphics bugs !
<li>
I am compiling a <a href=graphicstodos.html>list</a> 
of missing features or inconsistencies in R graphics that I'd like to get to.
There might be some useful things in here for small student projects.
