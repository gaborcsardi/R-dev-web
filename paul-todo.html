page in particular.</i>

<li>
Lattice Graphics:  An R package of "alternative" graphical functions, the 
main aim of which is to provide graphical support for being able to 
produce Trellis-like graphics.
<li> 
Trellis Graphics:  Use the Lattice Graphics package
to replicate as much as possible 
of Trellis.  NOTE that Bill Cleveland has pointed out (and the 
Trademark Electronic Search System will back him up if necessary) that neither
"Trellis" nor "Trellis Graphics" are registered trademarks (for a
statistical graphics application).  One of Doug Bates' students,
Deepayan Sarkar, has already
produced some code for "xyplot"s that will hopefully form a basis for 
a more complete implementation.
<li>
Implement the "density" and "angle" arguments of polygon() as per S-Plus.
<li>
Attack the long list of graphics bugs !
<li>
I am compiling a <a href=graphicstodos.html>list</a> 
of missing features or inconsistencies in R graphics that I'd like to get to.
There might be some useful things in here for small student projects.
