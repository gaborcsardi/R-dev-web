I've rolled up R-~~VERSION~~.tar.gz a short while ago. 

~~EITHER:~~
This is a maintenance
release and fixes a number of mostly minor bugs and platform issues. 
~~OR:~~
This is a development 
release which contains a number of new features. 
~~POSSIBLY DESCRIBE HIGHLIGHTS~~

See the full list of changes below.

You can get it (in a short while) from

http://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-2/R-~~VERSION~~.tar.gz

or wait for it to be mirrored at a CRAN site nearer to you. Binaries
for various platforms will appear in due course.
