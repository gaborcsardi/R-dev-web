This is a collection of notes on the topic of compiling R with using a
strict ANSI C compatible compiler. We (Kurt and I) used the -ansi flag
for gcc and encountered the following problems.

<h2>arithmetic.c:</h2>
 struct exception and DOMAIN are in math.h iff __USE_SVID is defined. See features.h.
 STRICT_ANSI  leaves this symbol undefined.



<h2>connections.c</h2>
   IFDIR and IFIFO
 <br>
   See /usr/include/sys/stat.h and this conditionally defines
   __USE_XOPEN is probably the offender. Also, neither __USE_MISC or __USE_BSD are defined.

<h2>devPS.c:</h2>
   popen not declared.

<h2>platform.c</h2>
  S_IFDIR not there.




<h2>src/modules/X11</h2>
devX11.c:
  caddr_t is not defined.
    sys/types.h has definition within __USE_BSD
<p>
  This actually looks like it should be XPointer anyway, not caddr_t.
  (Some) Solaris doesn't declare this as XPointer for XSaveContext.
  Instead it uses _Xconst char *!

<p>
  fd_set in eventloop.h is not defined.

<h2>rotated.c:</h2>
  M_PI
<br>
   Problem is __USE_XOPEN again.


<h2>sock.c:</h2>
  struct sigaction not defined. 
  This is within a #if defined(SIGPIPE)
  

<h2>Miscellaneous Notes</h2>

The output showing the setting sat the end of running <b>configure</b> should
show the CPPFLAGS as part of the different compiler flags.
Since -ansi is part of CPPFLAGS, enabling it with
<pre>
  ./configure CPPFLAGS=-ansi
</pre>
means that is not visible in the displayed settings of the flags.
