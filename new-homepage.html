<h1>New Design of R Homepage</h1>

In the first week of February 2009 a <a
href="https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-help/2009-February/thread.html#186781">thread
on redesigning the R homepage</a> started on the r-help mailing
list. Here is a (not necessarily complete) list of things that got
discussed and seemed to get approval by several of the people
involved. Order of items is not implying any importance.

<ul>
<li>More modern looks (the current design is from 1997+).  </li>
<li>Elegant spartan design (the art is to leave things out ...).</li>
<li>No frames.</li> <li>Reduce number of steps necessary to get from
homepage to actually downloading R.</li> <li>Usability first (for
users and for web admins).</li> <li>All valid (X)HTML and CSS.</li>
<li>A good user interface that works with as many browsers as possible
should be the primary design criteria. We don't need eye candy.</li>
<li>Pages should load fast even on older hardware (R is very popular
in developing countries).  <li>Pages should be friendly to those with
visual impairment.</li> <li>No usage of a real content management
system, we want to check the homepage into SVN. Creation of HTML files
via scripts/translations/...  from other source format is fine
(Rscripts are of course preferred).</li> <li>Use a graphic on the
front page that was rendered using new R graphics features like
anti-aliasing etc. A good set of candidates may be found in the <a
href="http://addictedtor.free.fr/graphiques/" target="_top">R Graph
Gallery</a>.</li> <li>It should be easy to create design-compliant
pages from within R (important for various listings on CRAN).</li>
<li>Javascript should be avoided, but may be allowed for extra parts
that adds <em>optional features</em> (like a daily changing figure on
the front page or zooming into screenshots).

</ul>
