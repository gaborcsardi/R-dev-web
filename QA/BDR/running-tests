I now run my tests only on 8-core Xeon or Intel Core 2 duo boxes, using

Xvfb :5 -screen 0 1280x1024x24 &
setenv DISPLAY :5
setenv _R_CHECK_FORCE_SUGGESTS_ FALSE
setenv MPI_ROOT /usr/lib64/lam
limit cputime 600
make clean unpack
make -j4 -k &

This usually manages to keep the two processors running at close to 100% 
In the past various packages have needed to be checked without parallel make,
but only the version of AffyTiling in BioC 2.4 is an exception: there is a
provision in the Makefile for such packages.

There are problems with several packages leaving processes running,
and these can mount up.  I now avoid acroread and firefox instances
by setting R_BROWSER and R_PDFVIEWER in 'script', and skip the examples in
dynGraph as it leaves 2 java instances running.

~/ripley/R/test-library has an install of all the packages I can
install, including the off-CRAN package yags and I also have almost all
BioC and some Omegahat packages.  I cannot install

RDieHarder	broken configure
ROracle		no 64-bit Oracle
RScaLAPACK	no support software
Rcplex		no support software
Rlsf		no support software
VhayuR		is really Windows-only, and needs commercial software there

The BioC installations need to be matched to the version of R: e.g.
BioC-2.5 is for pre-2.10.0.
