I now run my tests only on dual Opteron boxes, using

Xvfb :5 -screen 0 1280x1024x24 &
setenv DISPLAY :5
limit cputime 300
make clean unpack
make -j4 -k &

This usually manages to keep the two processors running at close to 100% 
In the past various packages have needed to be checked without parallel make,
but there seem no current exceptions.


/users/ripley/R/test-library has an install of all the packages I can
install, including the off-CRAN package yags and I also have almost all
BioC and Omegahat packages.  I cannot install

BRugs		Windows only
RGrace		RGTk will not install
RMySQL		MySQL is installed but fails to find it.
ROracle		no 64-bit Oracle
RQuantLib	Quantlib fails to build on AMD64
RScaLAPACK	no support software
RWinEdt		Windows only
Rlsf		no support software
Rmpi		no support software
gnomeGUI	not built with libR.so
mimR		Windows only
rcom		Windows only
rpvm		no support software
rsprng		no support software
taskPR		no support software
tcltk2		Windows only

The following give problems with running checks:

sampfling	infinite-loops on AMD64

Coco, NORMT3, assist, bitops, haplo.stats, latentnet: segfault on tests.

aod, kza, mlmRev, gamlss, tgp, titan, twang: run out of time (as do dprep,
hoa and mclust if an optimized BLAS is used).
