I now run my tests only on dual Opteron boxes, using

kill any existing Xvfb
Xvfb :5 &
setenv DISPLAY :5
limit cputime 300
make clean unpack
make -j3 -k &

This usually manages to keep the two processors running at close to 100% 
(I saw 196% usage for tcsh).
In the past various packages have needed to be checked without parallel make,
but there seem no current exceptions.


/users/ripley/R/test-library has an install of all the packages I can
install, including the off-CRAN packages VGAM and yags and quite a few
BioC and Omegahat packages.  I cannot install

BRugs		Windows only
FLCore		fails
GeneNT		prerequisites will not install
RGrace		RGTk will not install
RMySQL		MySQL is installed but to fails to find it.
ROracle		no 64-bit Oracle
RQuantLib	Quantlib fails to build on AMD64
RScaLAPACK	no support software
RWinEdt		Windows only
Rlsf		no support software
Rmpi		no support software
gnomeGUI	not built with libR.so
mimR		Windows only
portfolio	fails
rcom		Windows only
rpvm		no support software
rsprng		no support software
taskPR		no support software
tcltk2		Windows only
ncdf, udunits	error in configure script

The following give problems with running checks:

rgl		tends to crash the Xvfb server (and the console server)
		on initialization.
Rcmdr, misc3d	load rgl
sampfling	infinite-loops on AMD64

Coco, NORMT3, assist, bitops, haplo.stats, latentnet: segfault on tests.

aod, kza, mlmRev, gamlss, tgp, twang: run out of time (as do dprep, hoa and
mclust if an optimized BLAS is used).
