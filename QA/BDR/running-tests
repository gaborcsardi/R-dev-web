I now run my tests only on dual Opteron or Intel Core 2 duo boxes, using

Xvfb :5 -screen 0 1280x1024x24 &
setenv DISPLAY :5
setenv _R_CHECK_FORCE_SUGGESTS_ FALSE
limit cputime 300
make clean unpack
make -j4 -k &

This usually manages to keep the two processors running at close to 100% 
In the past various packages have needed to be checked without parallel make,
but there seem no current exceptions.


/users/ripley/R/test-library has an install of all the packages I can
install, including the off-CRAN package yags and I also have almost all
BioC and Omegahat packages.  I cannot install

BRugs		Windows only
RDieHarder	not clear what version of DieHarder, but latest fails
ROracle		no 64-bit Oracle
RQuantLib	Quantlib fails to build on AMD64
RScaLAPACK	no support software
RWinEdt		Windows only
Rlsf		no support software
Rmpi		builds, but not out of the box.
gnomeGUI	not built with libR.so
mimR		Windows only
rcom		Windows only
taskPR		no support software
tcltk2		Windows only
tdm		depends on BRugs
xlsReadWrite	Windows only
ncdf, udunits	error in configure script

The following give problems with running checks:

binom, geometry, sampfling	infinite-loops on AMD64 (with gcc 4.2.2)

Coco, NORMT3, latentnet, rqmcmb2, stochasticGEM: segfault on tests.

mlmRev, tgp, twang: run out of time (as do dprep,
hoa and mclust if an optimized BLAS is used).
