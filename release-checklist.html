<ul>
<li> Update <tt>.save</tt> files (notably <tt>internet.Rout.save</tt>).
<li> Update reference to BioC versions.  (This needs the BioC
  maintainers to have set up <strong>all four</strong> BioC repositories for the
  development version.  Nowadays done not later than GFF.)
<li> Relabeling inside NEWS.
<li> Update bug repository settings, so that people can report on new versions.
<li> Update <tt>tools/config.{guess,sub}</tt> from the git URLs given
  within them.  (These are GPL-3 but with an exception.)
<li> Update software included under <tt>src/extra</tt>:
  <ul>
    <li> <a href="http://laurikari.net/tre/download/">tre</a>
    <li> <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ctrio/files/">trio</a>:
    only used on Windows.
    <li> <a href="http://www.iana.org/time-zones">tzone</a>: this
    amounts to picking up the latest <tt>tzdata</tt> file, and on a
    machine with a fully 64-bit <tt>zic</tt> (usually Linux, not OS X)
    following the procedure in <tt>src/extra/tzone/Notes</tt>.
    <li> <a href="https://github.com/win-iconv/win-iconv">win_iconv</a>:
    only used on Windows.

    <li> <a href="http://www.bzip.org">bzip2</a>
    <li> <a href="http://www.pcre.org">PCRE</a>
    <li> <a href="http://tukaani.org/xz/">xz</a>
    <li> <a href="http://zlib.net">zlib</a>. We now only use the
    basic interface, not the buggy gzio one.
  </ul>
  The last four are essentially frozen as from R 3.1.3, as
  system/external versions should be used.  Only port critical bug
  fixes to the R sources.

<p>
  We don't update <tt>intl</tt> (originally for licence reasons, but
  it reverted to LGPL 2.1).
</ul>
