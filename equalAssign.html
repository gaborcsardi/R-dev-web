<h1>Assignments with the <code>=</code> Operator</h1>

The development version of R now allows some assignments to be written
C- or Java-style, using the <code>=</code> operator.  This increases
compatibility with S-Plus (as well as with C, Java, and many other
languages).
<p>
All the previously allowed assignment operators (<code><-</code>,
<code>:=</code>, <code>_</code>, and <code><<-</code>)
remain fully in effect.  The <code>=</code> operator is semantically
equivalent to all of these, except the last.
<p>
<h3>Limitations Imposed</h3>
<p>
The new assignments are allowed in only two places in the grammar:  at
the top level (as a complete program or user-typed expression); and as
an element in a braced list of expressions.  In all other places, one
of the existing assignment operators must be used.
<p>
So the following are allowed:
<code><pre>
> y = runif(10)
> zzz = list(a=y, b="Test")
> zzz$a[1] = NA
> for(i in 1:10) { xx = min(rnorm(100)); zzz$a[i] = xx}
</pre></code>
But the following is not:
<code><pre>
> while((temp = y[i]) > .5) i 
Error: syntax error
</pre></code>
Embedded assignments of this sort have to be done with one of the older
assignment operators.
<p>
There are two reasons for the restricitions:
<ol>
  <li> Some restriction is needed, because the same syntax is used for
      specifying named arguments in function calls.  The additional
      restrictions are minor by comparison.<p>
  <li> Disallowing the new assignment form in control expressions
      avoids some infamous C-style programming errors, such as
      <code><pre>
      while(result = 0) ## do something important (but it won't happen!)
      </pre></code>
</ol>
<p>
The restrictions do produce some other limitations that users may find
less intuitive, because some functions are thought of as special.  For
example, the <code>quote</code> function.
      <code><pre>
> quote(y = 1)
[1] 1
> quote(y = 1:10)
1:10
> quote(y[1] = 1)
Error: syntax error
      </pre></code>
(The function is implemented as a special that doesn't check argument
names.   The first two examples just use <code>y</code> as the
argument name, and the third fails because the expression on the left
of the <code>=</code> operator isn't valid as an argument name.)
