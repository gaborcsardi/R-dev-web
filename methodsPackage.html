<h1>The <code>methods</code> package in the r-devel code</h1>

A package, <code>methods</code>, has been added to the source
repository for the 1.4 version of R.
<p>
The contents provide an implementation of formal classes and methods,
treating the description in the book ``Programming with Data''
(hereafter PwD; aka the green book).  The following notes introduce a
few topics for discussion regarding R development.  (The source of the
package replaces, and updates, the Omegahat module
<code>R/Classes</code>.)
<ol>
  <li> <i>Where should the code reside?</i><p>
The code is currently being kept in a package, in the main CVS tree so it's
      guaranteed to be shipped with the corresponding development
      version of R.<p>
      This may be a temporary situation,  but it has the advantage that one
      can detach the package, if it turns out to break something
      else (e.g., see the next list item).  Discussions so far suggest
      that in the long run at least part of the code will need to be
      pretty tightly bound to the evaluator for efficiency and to work
      well with some other new developments such as threading.<p>
      The eventual choice may be to incorporate all of the package
      into the base.  We should discuss this as things move along.
      <p>
  <li> <i>Revised versions of <code>get</code>, etc.</i><p>
      You will see when attaching <code>methods</code> that it
      overrides a bunch of functions dealing with object access.  The
      main change is to replace <code>pos.to.env</code> with a more
      general function, <code>as.environment</code>.  I think the
      changes are back-compatible.  Details are in a
      <a href="NotesOnGet.html">separate note</a>.<p>
  <li> <i>Extensions to the Grammar</i><p>
      The <code>@</code> operator has been added for accessing
      slots--this is pretty trivial, but as it's implemented as a
      primitive, it is now in the base.<p>
      I would also like to add a <i>limited</i> use of
      <code>"="</code> for assignments:  only to be allowed for
      top-level assignments or for elements of a braced list.  The
      limitation removes any chance of the notorious
      <pre><code>
      if(x = 0) /* do something important */
      </code></pre>
      C bug, but still allows the PwD examples to be run.  (It's also
      useful, I think, in bringing in new users who have programmed in
      C, Java, even Fortran.)<p>
  <li> <i>S3 Classes and Methods</i><p>
      We need eventually to decide how to deal with these, if it turns
      out we want to make S4-style methods the standard.  The current
      implementation is fairly back-compatible, in the sense for
      example that one can treat matrices as a formal class and
      usually find that existing matrices conform.  (Because R slots
      are implemented as attributes.)<p>
      Full back-compatibility is probably not worth the effort, even
      if it is possible.  A conversion utility may help for some
      problems.  <p> A few things
      don't map.
      Most of these can be called abuses, even though not illegal;
      e.g., having two objects with the same class but with different,
      inconsistent attributes.
