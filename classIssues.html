<h1>Old- and New-Style Classes and Methods</h1>

Beginning with Version 1.4, R will have available formal class and
method definitions, assuming we don't back out current efforts.  These
are at the moment in package <code>methods</code>; they may partly or
entirely be moved into the base package.
<p>
The formal classes and methods implement most of the API defined in
<i>Programming with Data</i> (Springer, 1998).  See the <a
href="methodsPackage.html#Inconsistencies">companion page</a> for a
list of exceptions.
<p>
R also has an implementation of the informal classes and methods,
similar to that described in <i>Statistical Models in S</i> and other
books.  The present page outlines some of the issues in dealing with
two models.
<p>
The discussion will use the short forms``S3 classes'' and ``S4
classes'', since that terminology has become fairly common.
But what we mean throughout is the existing R mechanisms and the new
(and future) more formal mechanisms.

<h3>Class, the <code>"class"</code> Attribute, and
<code>is.object</code></h3>


In the S4 class model, every object has a class, and the class is
always a single character string.
In the S3 class model, <code>class(x)</code> is the attribute named
<code>"class"</code>, which may be anything.
In particular, it will be a character vector informally interpreted as
the ``primary'' class of the object in the first string, and other
classes that the object inherits possibly as additional elements in
the vector.
The attribute can also be <code>NULL</code>; that is, not there.
<p>
In R, extra efficiency is obtained in the S3 class dispatch by
allocating a bit in the sxpinfo field at the C level.  The R function
<code>is.object</code> tests that bit, which is asserted to be 1 iff
there is a class attribute of length greater than zero.
<p>
The current R implementation of S4 classes uses the class attribute to
hold the class, but never allows <code>NULL</code> values for
<code>class(x)</code>; if the attribute is not there, the value
returned follows the logic of <code>data.class</code>; that is, arrays
and matrices are recognized by examining the <code>dim</code>
attribute, if any, and the default is essentially
<code>typeof(x)</code>.
<p>
The implementation does not enforce the class to be a single string,
but it will be if the class is formally defined.
<p>
For compatibility, the source of most difficulty will be code written
for S3 classes that uses, explicitly or implicitly, the test:
<code><pre>
   is.null(class(x))
</pre></code>
As Luke Tierney points out, the preferred alternative for
efficiency (and now, importantly, for correctness) is:
<code><pre>
   !is.object(x)
</pre></code>
<p>
For future consideration, what should happen to the <code>obj</code>
bit in the internal representation?  Should it be retained?  Should
there be a bit instead or in addition for formally defined classes?


<h3>The <code>noquote</code> Example</h3>
<p>
One of the best examples of inconsistency in the underlying models is
the <code>noquote</code> function and ``class''.  The function returns
its argument but with <code>"noquote"</code> either added to the class
attribute or forming the class attribute by itself.<p>
The purpose is to force use of the <code>print.noquote</code> method
for printing the object:  The method strips off the added string from
the class and recalls <code>print</code> with a
<code>quote=FALSE</code> argument, to suppress quotes on strings.<p>
There is no class <code>"noquote"</code> in the formal sense; any
object whatsoever can have that string in its class attribute.
Conversely, two objects ``from'' another class can have different
class attributes if one has passed through the <code>noquote</code>
function.
<p>
It's not that this procedure is invalid, from the definition of S3
classes.  But it has no possible mapping directly into S4 classes.
<p>
It's interesting to note, though, how the same intent would be
implemented there.  One could define a <i>class</i>
<code>"noquote"</code>.  It would be a virtual class, only existing so
actual classes  could extend it.  Print methods could be designed
somewhat as before.  It's probably more likely that not a large number
of classes would extend <code>"noquote"</code> however; instead,
something like <code>"noquoteCharacter"</code> would be a class of
character vectors that printed without quotes.
