On this blogging site R developers share their experience, ideas and
plans related to R core implementation.  Technical details presented here
might be useful for package developers and interesting for
technically-minded R enthusiasts.

The blog posts represent individual opinions of their authors. Unless stated
so explicitly, they should not be taken as positions of R Core nor R
Foundation. 

In the interest of technical quality of the posts, the authors may modify
existing posts after publication.

The website is generated using the
[**blogdown**](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) package and
[**Hugo**](https://gohugo.io).  The theme is based on
[@jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme](https://github.com/jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme)
and on modifications by [Yihui
Xie](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-lithium-theme), with additional
modifications for this particular site.  More features are
expected when there is more content on the site.
