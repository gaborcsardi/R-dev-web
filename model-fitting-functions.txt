[Under construction]

This page documents some of the special features that are available to
model-fitting functions in R, and especially the safety features that
can (and should) be enabled.

By model-fitting functions we mean functions like lm which take a
formula, create a model frame and perhaps a model matrix, and have
methods (or use the default methods) for many of the standard accessor
functions such as coef(), residuals() and predict().

A fairly complete list of such functions in the standard and
recommended packages is

base: lm, glm
lqs: lqs
modreg: loess, ppr
mva: factanal, princomp
MASS: glm.nb, lqs.gls, polr, rlm
mgcv: mgcv
rpart: rpart

model arg
xlevels
contrasts
predict check classes
