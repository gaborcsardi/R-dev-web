Updating packages for 1.7.0
===========================

Package maintainers should be aware of the following changes scheduled
to appear in 1.7.0.


print.matrix() only exists for backwards compatibility: it is the same
as print.default().  Very likely print.matrix was used for the
right=TRUE argument that S's print.default does not have, but this is
unnecessary.  If you the call sequence of print.matrix, use prmatrix
instead.


Constructions that used is.null(class(x)) will probably not work as
intended, as all objects have a class when the `methods' package is
attached (as it is by default).  Constructions like

	 if(is.null(class(x))) class(x) <- data.class(x)

can be replaced by

	 if(is.null(attr(x, "class"))) class(x) <- data.class(x)

to work with or without `methods' (they are unnecessary when `methods'
is attached).
