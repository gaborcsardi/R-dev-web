Updating packages for 1.7.0
===========================

Package maintainers should be aware of the following changes scheduled
to appear in 1.7.0.


Current generic functions that call, say UseMethod("abc") may behave
differently if there are functions named, for example, abc.matrix,
abc.numeric, abc.character, etc.  Because matrices have class "matrix"
(when the `methods' package is attached, the default), the function
abc.matrix will be treated as a method for function abc() when the
first argument is a matrix.

You will need to rename the function, for example to abcMatrix instead
of abc.matrix.  This applies also if you have a function named in this
way for one of the generic functions in base or another required
package: for example, plot.matrix would be interpreted as a plot
method for matrix objects.


print.matrix() only exists for backwards compatibility: it is the same
as print.default().  Very likely print.matrix was used for the
right=TRUE argument that S's print.default does not have, but this is
unnecessary.  If you want the call sequence of print.matrix, use prmatrix
instead.  Also, note that print(.default) prints the attributes of the matrix 
whereas prmatrix does not.


Constructions that used is.null(class(x)) will probably not work as
intended, as all objects have a class when the `methods' package is
attached (as it is by default).  Constructions like

	 if(is.null(class(x))) class(x) <- data.class(x)

can be replaced by

	 if(is.null(attr(x, "class"))) class(x) <- data.class(x)

to work with or without `methods' (they are unnecessary when `methods'
is attached).
