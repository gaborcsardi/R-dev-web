First of all tell us what system you are on. With that information,
all we can say is that that is not what is supposed to happen...

True, but we can tell you:

This is Linux/Unix not Windows (and not HP either).

That silly symbol name suggests that this is the Fortran bug in RH6.2
we have met before.  If so, the solution is to compile with gcc-2.95.2.

When dmvnorm is applied to matrices it fails.  The offending lines are

  if (length(x) != ncol(sigma)) {
    stop("x and sigma have non-conforming size")
  }

which works fine if x is a dataframe, but not if x is a matrix.

Replacing this test with

  if (ncol(x) != ncol(sigma)) {
    stop("x and sigma have non-conforming size")
  }

Corrects the problem, and still works for data frames and
vectors.  (Vectors have already been converted to matrices).

I am using R 0.65.1 under linux (Redhat 6.0),
and I have a problem with the est.variogram function when the first lag is empty (I am trying to estimate anisotropic varios)

fittedpnt<-point(fitted, x="X2", y="X3")
fittedpair<-pair(fittedpnt, num.lags=15, type="anisotropic", theta=60, dtheta=20, maxdist=maxfittedist)
fittedvario<-est.variogram(fittedpnt, fittedpair, "fit")

With my datas I have no pair in lags 1 to 3 and the error message is :
Error in psort(x, partial) : index 0 outside bounds

What can I do, in order to fix the bug ?

Subject: Postscript device ignores title if it is too long.

Hi,

This may just be an inconsistency between terminal drivers, rather
than a proper bug.

If the main title of a plot is too wide to all fit on the plot, the
X11 driver prints as much of the title as it can, but the postscript
driver totally ignores the title.

Here's a simple example:

% R
> plot(runif(1000), main="a long xxxxxxxxxxxx title") 
> dev.print(file="test.ps")

On my setup, I needed about 110 x's in the title to reproduce this
problem.  This may seem an unlikely long title, but I found the
problem when using much shorter titles on multiple figures (created
using par(mfrow=c(2,3)) for example).

Perhaps the postscript driver could give a warning if the title is
too long to be printed?  

Also, I found a small typo in R-1.0.1/src/library/base/man/postscript.Rd
 - on line 48:
%%>>> REAL DOC in SOURCE:    ../../../main/devices.c  &   ../../../unix/devPS.c
the pathname to devPS.c should be: ../../../main/devPS.c


Cheers,

Stephen

Subject: persp box occlusion bug

Full_Name: Bill Simpson
Version: 64.1
OS: linux
Submission from: (NULL) (193.62.250.209)


Bug in persp() bounding box:
If the surface being plotted extends below the lower z-axis boundary, the box
is
drawn with the wrong occlusion. The box is shown as being occluded by the
surface
even though it should be in front of the surface.

The box is correct for surface extending above the box. Problem is only for
surface extending below the box.

This exhibits the bug:

std<-rep(seq(-32,32,8),9)/1000 * 60
cf<-rep(seq(-32,32,8),rep(9,9))/1000 *60 
dp<-(cf-std)/.6
std<-unique(std)
cf<-unique(cf)
dp<-t(matrix(dp,length(cf),length(std)))
persp(std,cf,dp, xlim=c(-2,2), ylim=c(-2,2), zlim=c(0,5),theta=-40,    
phi=45,
box=TRUE,ltheta=-120, lphi=120,

Hi,

  Kudos to all who've worked on getting 1.1 out.  It installs cleanly on
  Linux and Sun.  But AIX, of course, is a problem...

  When linking shared libs, the symbols from libc.a are not found.  I
  apologize for not investigating this further at the moment - they
  may not be properly or not all exported from R.bin.

  Fix: I've added ' -lc' to SHLIBLDFLAGS in Makeconf and etc/Makeconf in
  my build directory after running configure.  Then compilation proceeds
  without problems.
  (Alternatively, you could use cc instead of ld to link.)

  Regards,
  -tom
 

P.S. Any reason the status field is empty?  It is stable, right? ;-)

It looks as though you are trying to use GNU readline without it being
present.  This shouldn't be allowed by configure.

Try 
     make distclean
     ./configure
     make

again, to see if the problem goes away. If it doesn't then
look at src/include/config.h to see if you have something like
/* GNU Readline Library */
#define HAVE_LIBREADLINE 1
#define HAVE_READLINE_HISTORY_H 1
#define HAVE_READLINE_READLINE_H 1
indicating that configure thinks you have readline or like
/* GNU Readline Library */
/* #undef HAVE_LIBREADLINE */
/* #undef HAVE_READLINE_HISTORY_H */
/* #undef HAVE_READLINE_READLINE_H */
indicating that it doesn't.

In either case there would be a problem with configure, but a different
one. It's possible, for example, that configure is finding the readline
headers but that the compiler isn't looking in the same place.

Of course this is assuming you do have the GNU readline library and
headers. If you don't, then
	./configure --without-readline
is a workaround, though we would still like to know why configure thinks
you have it.

That's a pretty heavy set of optimization options you're using there!

Basically, there are two possibilities:

1) You've triggered a compiler bug
2) You've triggered a bug in R

In either case, you'll have to dig deeper and see if you can catch the
exact spot where things go wrong. You might start R with the debugger,
run the base-Ex.R with it while having a breakpoint set at the error
message you are getting. But before that try running the example that
triggers the bug by itself and see if the bug is still tickled.

Don't shure what I should think about it. 

my compiler is:

>gcc --version
2.95.2

R is compiled using the

"-fPIC -O3 -fstrict-aliasing -ffast-math -funroll-loops -mpentiumpro -march=pentiumpro -fschedule-insns2"

compiler switches. I used 

./configure --with-g77 --enable-blas_risc --enable-readline --with-x

for configuring.

I can't help noticing that you are configuring for a RISC optimized BLAS
library on an Intel x86 processor.  I have no idea if this is serious,
but it seems a bit odd.

Since this feature was added for PowerPC Linux distributions at my
request, I'll comment on this.  I would say that it is very unlikely to
be of any help, but it probably won't hurt.  The configure script will
check to see if libblas_risc can be located.  If it can't be found, it
won't be used.  Configure won't even look for it unless you request it
with --enable-blas_risc.

Furthermore, I don't believe that configure will actually use
libblas_risc unless you also --enable-blas.  I could be wrong in that
regard.  Using --enable-blas_risc could implicitly --enable-blas as
well. It's been many months since I wrote that configure option.  I do
know that configure will test if linking -lblas works first.  If that
fails, it won't even bother with -lblas_risc.  

Hope this helps,

Subject:  exists() and the mode argument 

The following seems to be odd behaviour:

fred <- 1:10
mode(fred) # "numeric"
exists("fred") # TRUE
exists("fred", mode="numeric") # FALSE

Unless I have misunderstood, the final evaluation should be TRUE,
as an object called "fred" exists and its mode is "numeric".  In
the same category, I have just noticed that

get("fred") # 1:10
get("fred", mode="numeric") # gives an Error: variable "fred" was not found

Cheers, Jonathan.

Its `mode' is

[1] "integer"

and so

[1] TRUE

See ?exists

    mode: the type of interest for the object.
              ^^^^ 

I think this needs to be re-written in the documentation, or do
people think it should be the value of mode?  The latter appears
to be what the prototype uses, in that

> exists("fred", mode="numeric")
[1] T
> exists("fred", mode="integer")
[1] T
> exists("fred", mode="double")
[1] T

Call objects don't always behave as you'd expect. They're mostly
list-like, but with exceptions:

> f<-function(x,y,...)match.call(expand.dots=FALSE)
> xx <- f(y=1,2,z=3,4)
> dd <- xx$...
> xx$... <- NULL
> c(xx,dd)
[[1]]
f(x = 2, y = 1)

$z
[1] 3

[[3]]
[1] 4

> as.call(c(as.list(xx),dd))
f(x = 2, y = 1, z = 3, 4)

(Splus has this rather differently, since dd becomes a call to list()
rather than a list of promises:

S> c(xx,dd)
f(x = 2, y = 1, list, z = 3, 4)
S> as.call(c(as.list(xx),dd))
f(x = 2, y = 1, list, z = 3, 4)

...but at least gives the same in both cases)

Also, the names of arguments added with [[<- is getting dropped if a
new element is required:

> xx[["abc"]]<-123
> xx
f(x = 2, y = 1, 123)

S has what I'd expect there:

S> xx[["abc"]]<-123
S> xx
f(x = 2, y = 1, abc = 123)

[R-0.99.0 prerelease on RedHat6.1, but this is likely not a new thing.]

I reported this on r-help, but here is official bug report.

The present convolve() does not do convolution by default. Its default behaviour
is
correlation. This is a bug.

The default argument conj should be set to FALSE.

The zero-padding should be on the right for linear convolution (don't ask me
why you call this type="open"; I suggest type="linear").

Here is what I expect linear convolution to do:
myconvolve<-function (x,h) 
{
    nx <- length(x)
    nh <- length(h)
    #zero pad
    if(nx>nh)
       {
       x <- c(x,rep(0, nh-1))
       h<-c(h,rep(0,nx-1))
       }
    else
       {
       h <- c(h,rep(0, nx-1))
       x<-c(x,rep(0,nh-1))
       }
    x <- fft(fft(x) * fft(h), inv = TRUE)
    Re(x)/length(x)
#I am not sure about this, the R IFFT is weird
}

What "circular" convolution should do is just
eliminate the zero-padding:

myconvolve2<-function (x,h)
{
#no padding, circular convolution
    nx <- length(x)
    nh <- length(h)
    x <- fft(fft(x) * fft(h), inv = TRUE)
    Re(x)/(nx)
}


I suggest that you create two functions, convolve() and correlate(), and get
rid
of the conj argument in convolve().

Hello!

I'm afraid I have another obscure bug. 
R has just crashed with a segmentation fault. 
This time, I have even failed to reproduce it, but fortunately, 
I have a core dump. It's at 
<URL:http://www.astro.uio.no/~kjetikj/tmp/core>

The call I did was 
log10(quantile(chisqtests5M11001, c(0.05, 0.95)))
where chisqtests5M11001 is an array of length 1500 
(it's an array of p-values produced by the chisq.test, but I 
doubt that it is relevant). 

I did lots of strange things prior to the crash, some even 
involving for-loops, but I can't tell what is relevant. Anyway,
a transcript of the session is at 
<URL:http://www.astro.uio.no/~kjetikj/tmp/crash.Rt>

That's all I've got....

If an error occurs during a save the file does not appear to be
closed and buffers flushed.  This can lead to corruption if the same
filename is used later and then the buffer is flushed on program exit.

For example, tn the context of PR #504

 f<-function(x,...){ function(y) list(x=x,y=y,...)}
 a<-f(1,2,3)
 save(list="a",file="a.rdata")  ## -- error --
 b<-1:10
 save(list="b",file="a.rdata")
 load("a.rdata")  ## works
 q("no")
 
 R

 load("a.rdata")  ## error



This is R1.0 on Linux

I tried this, but it does not work :

try(autoload(..)) works okay when used after startup, but not *during*
startup.  However, I'll put a workaround into Common.R

Should this {try(.) not working during startup} be another bug report ?

(i.e. my version Solaris, see below...)

Note that system() is not only implemented quite system-dependently
(which you'd very much expect!) but also Unix and Windows have quite
different arguments apart from the first two.

Hence all the following is ``Unix-only'' :


A user stumbled across this when using read.table.url(.) on a platform
where no "wget" is installed: 

The data is read ok, but an ugly message appears *before* the command is
completed :
	  -------------------
	  sh: wget: not found
	  -------------------
which made the user believe that the data wasn't read properly.

The problem is easily tracked to the system(..) call in download.file()
{which does not (yet) have the "ignore.stderr = TRUE" setting, btw}
and found that on our Solaris environment, 
the ignore.stderr argument does not seem to have any effect, i.e.

  > system("bla", ignore.stderr = TRUE)

gives the same as  system("bla"), namely
  
  sh: bla: not found
 
On my Linux environment,  ignore.stderr works as advertized.

Further note that  help(system)  should probably also say something about which
shell may or may not be used (I think we decided that we want it to be `sh'
on Unix).

Under sh you cannot redirect the output from a command until the command
is running.  That is, you are not redirecting the error messages from sh,
only from the command.  Unless the command runs, ignore.stderr has no
effect.

> On my Linux environment,  ignore.stderr works as advertized.

Depends how you read the advertising.

Yes, and you almost certainly got bash *not* sh on your Linux, and that
behaves differently.  I think you will find that a closer sh clone (such as
ash) does show the error message.  That some Linux systems claim to have sh
and do not is a major compatibility problem in writing shell scripts and
Makefiles, as we keep finding.

BTW, Solaris will use ksh not sh for the shell if it needs to be POSIX
compatible. And ksh behaves like bash in this respect.


I believe that to define this portably we are going to have to do something
a lot more complicated than accept what the system() call gives us. Are you
volunteering, Martin?

I'm having sporadic problems with glm on my alpha workstation running
Compaq Tru64 UNIX V5.0 (I can't replicate the problem on my Linux PC). I
have the same problem whether I use a version of R built with the native
C-compiler or a version compiled with gcc. In both cases I've built with
g77.

I want to do some simulations with a call to glm in each rep. A simplified
version would be something like:

N_100; NREPS_100; lam.e_5; logit.inv_function(x){ exp(x)/(1+exp(x)) }
for(i in (1:NREPS)) {
   cat(paste("REP",i,"\n"))
   T_rexp(N,(lam.e))
   Delta_rbinom(N,1,logit.inv(1+T))
   ff_glm(Delta ~ T,family=binomial(logit))
}
 
It often completes all reps, but I occasionally get errors related to
lengths of various objects, etc.:

REP 1 
REP 2
<snip>
REP 9 
Error in model.matrix(t, data) : variable lengths differ


REP 1 
<snip>
REP 53 
Error: subscript out of bounds

REP 1 
<snip>
REP 41 
Error in model.matrix(t, data) : invalid variable type

Different error messages, different numbers of reps. When I call glm again
using the values of T and Delta just before the error, it runs error-free.
When I put the data in a data frame before calling glm I can also get
messages like:

REP 1 
<snip>
REP 64 
Error in model.frame(formula, rownames, variables, varnames, extras, extranames,  : 
        invalid variable type

I just did the above ~10 times on i386 and nothing happened. We've had
previous reports on trouble in the lm/glm/model.matrix etc. region on
Alpha. 

If you compile with all warnings on, are you getting warnings on
pointer/integer comparisons or assignments?

Can you create a reproducible case (with set.seed to keep the random
generator sequence constant) and would you know how run a debugger on
your version so that we can figure out what is going wrong?

I'll see what I can do about getting a more reproducible error. 

Any tips on what to look for if I'm running R within GDB? I don't have
much experience with the debugger. I mostly just use it to see where my
programs are dying. But R is not -- it just gives strange error messages.

TIA,
Brad

Add a line (third one here) to src/include/R_ext/RS.h:

#ifndef R_RS_H
#define R_RS_H

#include <string.h> /* for memcpy */
#include "Rconfig.h" /* for F77_SYMBOL */

Those are all normal.

That looks like a regex bug, with a why? comment in the code. Change
(int) to (long), twice.

I've never seen those, but try adding

#define STDC_HEADERS 1

at the top of regex.c.  (I am not convinced that is the cause here.)

Normal, on a platform with xdr.

One technique is to set a breakpoint at the line that displays the
error, then you can inspect the condition that caused it (you may have
to go "up" a couple of times to get into an interesting environment.)

Sometimes, it turns out that a variable contains something that it
shouldn't due to memory corruption and then you may have to set a
breakpoint earlier in the code and then maybe a watchpoint on the
memory location.

Another thing that is useful even without gdb is to investigate the
output of traceback() and maybe set 

options(error=quote(DUMP <<- sys.status()))

which allows you to subsequently investigate any active environment at
the time of the error, e.g. using ls(envir=DUMP$sys.frames[[3]]), and
get("x",envir=DUMP$sys.frames[[3]]).

(Newer snapshots have a more elaborate dump.frames function, but the
above should do).

I looked into the glm problem some more. Seems to be a memory problem that
occurs just after garbage collection. The easiest way for me to
reproduce  the error is in lapply. I take a list and ask lapply to provide
the descriptive stat summary. I do this several times with the same list.
Most often it gives the correct summary, but just after allocSExp calls
R_gc, one of the summaries for a list element will be NULL. 

E.g for a data frame dat with five columns I get the following (having added
print statements in summary.default and in allocSExp just after the test
for whether gc is necessary):

> lapply(as.list(dat), summary, maxsum = maxsum)
[1] "exiting summary.default"
R_FreeSEXP == NULL  
[1] "exiting summary.default"
[1] "exiting summary.default"
[1] "exiting summary.default"
[1] "exiting summary.default"

I don't know if the following is relevant, but for some reason I've found 
I can avoid this particular problem if I make a small change in lapply in 
its main loop.  Around line 50 of apply.c:

    PROTECT(ans = allocVector(VECSXP, n));
    for(i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        INTEGER(ind)[0] = i + 1;
        VECTOR(ans)[i] = eval(R_fcall, rho);
    }

if I change it to make an assignment to a
temporary variable first everything seems to work fine:

    PROTECT(ans = allocVector(VECSXP, n));
    for(i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        INTEGER(ind)[0] = i + 1;
        tem = eval(R_fcall, rho);
        VECTOR(ans)[i] = tem;
    }

hasn't given me any NULLs yet.

Now that is pretty darn odd... Looks quite a bit like a compiler bug.
Those two pieces of code should be equivalent as far as I can see.

One thing that you might do: objdump -dS apply.o allows you to see
what code the compiler generates for the two cases. Also, of course,
you can try reducing the level of optimization.


Alternatively, the mere addition of "tem" changes the local memory use
of that function so that something that got clobbered before doesn't
get clobbered now.

The effect doesn't seem to be present on Intels:

> dfr<-do.call("data.frame",lapply(1:100,function(i)rnorm(100)))
> any(sapply(lapply(dfr,summary),is.null))

Just to update: What I originally thought was a glm problem appears to be
a memory problem that occurs only when R is compiled with the DEC C
compiler. Some variables that are still in use get clobbered during
garbage collection. No problems if I compile with gcc though. I've made
some attempts to see if I can identify a specific compiler optimization
that is responsible, but so far no luck.

Hmm. Doesn't happen here. (BTW: Remember to include as much
information about your system as you can think of. It's not obvious
whether you're running RedHat or SuSE for instance and in what
version.)

This would seem to be the problem: the dynamic library isn't there.
Did you get any error messages while compiling the package? (Except
for "...might be used uninitialized..." of which there are quite a few
here too).

Oh. Didn't see that. Then that part is OK. Sorry.

Hmmm. Interesting: I can provoke the crash on *my other* RedHat6.2

Looks like it is happening during the dynamic linking itself. Doesn't
look nice. (But installing gcc 2.95.2 might fix your problem.)

Digital Alpha (various), Digital UNIX V4.0[EF], R-1.0.0, gcc, f77

When using batch mode with the save option, an error message is issued.
However [I have just discovered that] it appears that the operation
does complete, i.e. the .RData file is saved successfully.  The main
problem is that the return code is non-zero (and so it is impossible to
distinguish this "non-error" from some other error in a script).

Reproduce by:

    bats>  echo 'x <- 1' | R --save

    Type    "q()" to quit R.
    
    > x <- 1
    >

    bats> 

Note that an alternate form that achieves the same desired effect does
not issue any error messages:

    echo 'x <- 1; save(list = ls(), file = ".RData")' | R --no-save

I can't find any record of the configure summary output (is it saved
anywhere, or does it only appear on the screen?) but I could reproduce
this if necessary.

Hi,  I get the wrong eigen values on an AIX machine with R-devel of 5/3/00.

Here are the results:

R> m <- matrix (c(6.8, 2.4, 2.4, 8.2), nrow=2)
R> m
     [,1] [,2]
[1,]  6.8  2.4
[2,]  2.4  8.2
R> eigen(m)
$values
[1] 19.281403  6.337993

$vectors
          [,1]       [,2]
[1,] 0.1918866  0.9967987
[2,] 0.9967987 -0.1918866


And for comparison, here is what I get on a Sun (with r-stable):

R> m <- matrix (c(6.8, 2.4, 2.4, 8.2), nrow=2)
R> eigen (m)
$values
[1] 10  5

$vectors
     [,1] [,2]
[1,]  0.6  0.8
[2,]  0.8 -0.6


I found this by running "make check" which also stumbles over svd.
Please let me know how I can help to investigate this.

Hmm. We had a similar report a while back and it turned out to be
system specific. I believe the report was from Chong Gu.

When we last saw this bug it was compiler-specific.  gcc/g77 worked but
cc/f77 didn't (and I think gcc/f77 wouldn't even configure). 

I don't think we understand the bug, though.

Hi, I ran the test again with the newly released version of R (1.1) and I
now get the correct eigen values.  ("make check" succeeds.)

The scary part is that I think that I also used gcc+f77 last time and
the libs weren't changed.  Maybe the scary part is that I think...

So the comments that this is compiler specific probably hold.

Thanks,
  -tom

Hello,

needed by the sgeostat package.  After some careful searching,  three packages
were 
found which had the same error.  Here is the output.

That's a symbol from the Fortran I/O code.  There is no problem on RH6.0
on R 1.0.1, where the symbol is resolved from libg2c.a.

(1) Does FLIBS in etc/Makeconf include -lg2c?

(2) If so, do those packages have Makefiles in src? If so delete them
and reinstall.  (The latest version of akima does not, but earlier versions
did.)

(3) Does lg2c include e_wsfe?  (nm -g on it).  Is it finding the right
libg2c.a?

(4) I get nm -g ..../akima.so  giving

00013c5c T e_wsfe

and so I think it should be resolved in the *.so.

Which version of RedHat?  I suspect a RedHat inconsistency here, and other
people have reported that upgrading to the gcc-2.95.2 compiler set
solved the problem.  But it might just be old package versions.

That name e_wsfe probably comes from Fortran input/output routines.
Check if some Fortran code is trying to use a WRITE statement.  I
think there was another message this morning about this.

But did you build the packages yourself and if so, how? (using which
compilers).

BTW: when you follow up on an earlier report via the web interface,
please do it as a follow-up. If you do it by mail, say for PR#533,
please include (PR#533) in the Subject line. That way things get filed
together. (I've fixed the number on this mail)

===== R.bug.report =============================================
Hello,

We're experiencing problems with R 1.0.1 on the HP-UX system.
The most serious one is that the random-number generators don't work:

        R> runif(100)
        Error in runif(100) : .Random.seed[0] is not a valid Normal type

        R> .Random.seed
        [1] 18851  3338  2439

Is this a subscripting error?  Strange because building it on linux
works just fine.

Smaller errors I've noticed...  The command-line history doesn't work.
It was built by our computer-support people, and I think they had
trouble with the libraries for that.  (Contact is Ben Sherman,
bsherman@divms.uiowa.edu).  Also help.start() generates a bunch of
error messages:

R> help.start()
If netscape  is already running,        it is *not* restarted,
 and you must switch to its window.
Otherwise, be patient..

I think you've got a (very) old workspace being loaded there. Try starting
with R --vanilla to cross-check.

{Nothing really harmful;  R 1.1.0}

dim(.) sets (or doesn't clear) the  ``invisible flag'' for printing in
certain circumstances:

  > dim(a <- cbind(1))
  >

does *not* print as it should :

  > dim(a)
  [1] 1 1

---

Question to the real "hackers" :

How can I check this using R code alone (not using files),
i.e. (how) can I ask an R expression if its ``invisible flag'' is set or not ?

{help(invisible) doesn't help here}.

Maybe one would want an

      is.invisible(.)

function?

OS: osf1
Submission from: (NULL) (129.240.28.227)


Hello again!

This is a follow-up to my message on R-help about a problem with match.arg()
I have a little more on the topic, but not much really. 

First, it was not entirely true what I wrote in r-help that I call match.arg()
in my ramp(), because ramp() just calls qamp() with runif() as argument, but 
I have found that it happens both in ramp() and qamp().

Last night, just before I went home, R crashed with a segmentation fault. 
Unfortunately, I had limit coredumpsize 0, because I seldom want core-files,
so I haven't got it. I have removed that limit now. I have not been able to 
reproduce the crash, however.

Now, for a
> last.dump
$"apply(cbind(rep(1e+05, 25000)), 1, lineprofile, 10, 100, 1, "point")"
<environment: 140e187f0>

$"FUN(newX[, i], ...)"
<environment: 1404b6608>

$"apply(cbind(-as.integer(numberofbins/2):as.integer(numberofbins/2)), "
<environment: 1404b5460>

$"FUN(newX[, i], ...)"

<environment: 140e2d740>

attr(,"error.message")
[1] "Error in arg == choices : comparison (1) is possible only for vector
types\n"
attr(,"class")
[1] "dump.frames"

I have also inserted some print statements at some places in the code. First:
qamp <- function(p,  type=c("point", "nolens"))
{
  print(c(2,type))
  type <- match.arg(type)
  if(type == "point")
    return(1 / (2 * sqrt(1 - p)))
  else return(1)
}
  
ramp <- function(n, type=c("point", "nolens"))
{
  print(c(1,type))
  type <- match.arg(type)
  if(type == "point")
    return(qamp(runif(n), type))
  else return(rep(1, n))
}
(I'll rewrite these to use switch eventually).

And, also in match.arg():
match.arg <- function (arg, choices) {
    if (missing(choices)) {
	formal.args <- formals(sys.function(sys.parent()))
	choices <- eval(formal.args[[deparse(substitute(arg))]])
    }
    print(c(2, arg, choices))
    if (all(arg == choices)) return(choices[1])
[...]
Upon running, I get
[1] "1"     "point"
[1] "point"  "point"  "nolens"
[1] "2"     "point"
[1] "point"  "point"  "nolens"
[thousands of these... :-) ]
[1] "1"     "point"
[1] "point"  "point"  "nolens"
[1] "2"     "point"
[1] "point"  "point"  "nolens"
[1] "1"     "point"
[1] "point"  "point"  "nolens"
[1] "2"     "point"
[1] "point"
Error in arg == choices : comparison (1) is possible only for vector types
So, suddenly, "choices" doesn't have a value, and consequently, the error.
FWIW, I have also printed formals(qamp)$type inside qamp, and it has the 
right value. 

Now, it seems hard to reproduce, I just did 100000 runs of ramp(10000, "point")

directly with no problems. In my code, ramp is called by a function that is
called
by a function, that is... :-) 

However, the code isn't very involved, really, so if you want to try, here it
is:
ncloudsbin <- function(binno, ntotalclouds, numberofbins = 100,
                       linewidth = numberofbins / 6)
  return(ntotalclouds * dnorm(binno, sd = linewidth))

intensityfromcloud <- function(ncloudsbin, cloudintensity, exptime, amptype)
  return(cloudintensity * exptime * ramp(ncloudsbin, amptype))

photonsdetectedbin <- function(ncloudsbin, intensityfromcloud,
                               continuumintensity, exptime, amptype,
                               sensitivity)
  return(sum(rpois(ncloudsbin, sensitivity * intensityfromcloud))
         + rgeom(1, 1 /(1 + (sensitivity * exptime * continuumintensity))))



lineprofile <- function(ntotalclouds, intensityfromcloud, continuumintensity,
                        exptime, amptype, sensitivity = 0.1, numberofbins =
100,
                        linewidth = numberofbins / 6)
{
  tf <- function(binno, ntotalclouds, intensityfromcloud, continuumintensity,
                 exptime, amptype, sensitivity, numberofbins, linewidth)
  {
    ncb <- ncloudsbin(binno, ntotalclouds, numberofbins, linewidth)
    return(photonsdetectedbin(ncb,
                   intensityfromcloud(
                            ncb, intensityfromcloud, exptime, amptype),
                   continuumintensity, exptime, amptype, sensitivity))
  }
  return(apply(cbind(-as.integer(numberofbins/2):as.integer(numberofbins/2)),
               1, tf,
               ntotalclouds, intensityfromcloud, continuumintensity,
               exptime, amptype, sensitivity, numberofbins, linewidth)) 
}

Note that "amptype" is here the "type" of the ?amp-functions. 
I call this by e.g. 
ll25000 <- apply(cbind(rep(100000, 25000)), 1, lineprofile, 10, 100, 1,
"point")


Just an idea: I have some problems in an entirely unrelated and more involved 
piece of code where it seems like sometimes, arguments are not returned from a 
function, that is, one variable of an object suddenly has no value. I haven't
really figured out if that is a bug of mine or in R, but could it be possible 
that something in
	formal.args <- formals(sys.function(sys.parent()))
	choices <- eval(formal.args[[deparse(substitute(arg))]])
doesn't get a value because there is an error in how objects are returned 
from a function?

BTW, I was exiting R (my ESS buffer was getting rather large), and I got the
following:
Save workspace image? [y/n/c]: y
Error: NewWriteItem: unknown type 17

Well, I guess this isn't much go on, but I know you are really good at this!
By running the above code, the error happens on every run here, it is just a
matter
of letting it run for long enough. I hope it is something to start on. I have a
few
more last.dumps on file too, if they are of use.

That one was fixed in 1.0.1, I believe. (Perhaps you should upgrade
and see if the other problem goes away too... I don't see anything
obviously relevant in the NEWS file though)

Dear R team,

I don't get what I think I should get when using anova.glm() with
family="gaussian" -- please ignore this and forgive me if this turns out
to be another example of a fundamental misunderstanding on my part (a
highly likely event!) For example: 

S <- as.factor(rep(c(rep("m",2),rep("f",2)),2))
A <- as.factor(c(rep("a",4),rep("b",4)))
y <- c(10,11,13,15,12,11,16,17)

f.glm.1 <- glm(y~A*S)
f.glm.2 <- glm(y~A+S)
anova(f.glm.1,f.glm.2,test="F")

# Analysis of Deviance Table 
#
# Response: y
#
#
#             Resid. Df Resid. Dev Df Deviance     F Pr(>F)
# A + S + A:S         4      3.500                         
# A + S               5      4.625 -1    0.000 0.000      1

#  compared with the same analysis using anova.lm() below:

f.lm.1 <- aov(y~A*S)
f.lm.2 <- aov(y~A+S)
anova(f.lm.1,f.lm.2)

# Analysis of Variance Table
#
# Model 1: y ~ A + S + A:S
# Model 2: y ~ A + S
#   Res.Df Res.Sum Sq Df Sum Sq F value Pr(>F)
# 1      4      3.500                         
# 2      5      4.625 -1 -1.125  1.2857 0.3202


Thank you again for R and best regards,

Rashid Nassar

Hum.. It is being done on purpose. anova.glmlist has this nugget
inside:

    table <- data.frame(resdf, resdev, c(NA, -diff(resdf)), c(NA, 
        pmax(0, -diff(resdev))))

This is obviously inconsistent with the lm version, but I wonder which
one is wrong? There may be a point in requiring models to be in
increasing order. However, something is clearly wrong with that too:

> anova(f.glm.2,f.glm.1,test="F")
...
            Resid. Df Resid. Dev Df Deviance      F Pr(>F)
A + S               5     4.6250                          
A + S + A:S         4     3.5000  1   1.1250 1.2857 0.3745

Notice the p value! This comes from an F with 2 df in the denominator
instead of 4. Comes out of this bit:

    if (!is.null(test)) {
        bigmodel <- object[[(rdf <- order(resdf)[1])]]
        dispersion <- summary(bigmodel, dispersion =
        dispersion)$dispersion
        df.dispersion <- if (dispersion == 1) 
            Inf
        else rdf

which is clearly wrong since rdf will be an integer between 1 and the
number of models compared...

Many thanks for your reply.

For some reason I usually think about the models in decreasing order, and 
tend to list them that way in the argument to anova.  But as you noted 
that is not all of the problem.  Regarding the order: if there is a 
reason for requiring increasing order, then might it not be good to 
issue an error message or warning when the order used is wrong?

Thank you again!

Rashid

  The problem is that main/plot.c:do_playDL doesn't set the device 
  diplay list. Inserting towards the beginning a line like
          dd->dipslayList = theList;
  works for me at least under Unix. I will commit it after testing
  under Windows.

  BTW, Kaspar, I have no Windows at hand in this moment but 
  does the problem manifest itself also with the plot history mechanism?
  E.g., (i) if you set (with the menu) the graphics window in 
  'recording mode', (ii) make some plots , (iii) go back to the
  first plot using 'PgUp', (iv) add some new elements to it and 
  (v) go to some other plot and then back to the first plot 
  with 'PgDown' and 'PgUp', the first plot you get is the modified one
  or not? Reason of the question is that replayng of the saved history
  is implemented in a different way.

Ouch, another obscure bug...
I just had a bus error crash, with a core dump, a small one this time.
Usual <URL:http://www.astro.uio.no/~kjetikj/tmp/core>.
I had done a few simulations, and done a chisq.test() on them.
These simulations also write about 190MB's to file, but
I have no idea whether that is relevant, and those data are not
used. The calls I do look like this:
> ch1 <- chisq.test(t(apply(cbind(rep(5000000, 4)), 1, lineprofile, 1, 100,
"point")))
> ch1

	 Pearson's Chi-square test 

data:  t(apply(cbind(rep(5e+06, 4)), 1, lineprofile, 1, 100, "point")) 
X-squared = 463.8359, df = 300, p-value = 3.726e-09 

> ch1$observed

....so it doesn't crash when I print the whole object, but when I 
a vector of the object, it crashes... And, restarting R, it doesn't
happen.

I heard the sysadm who did the installation had some problems,
I don't know what it was about, but if I understood him correctly,
it only happened when he tuned for EV6, so it shouldn't be a problem now, 
I guess....

OK. I had a similar crash yesterday on a different machine but I think
with rather identical hardware, it was a batch job that was running
so I don't know exactly what caused the crash (after about 48 CPU hours,
arrgh), but I have a (small) core dump at
<URL:http://www.astro.uio.no/~kjetikj/tmp/core3>

Anyway, Uwe suggested it might be a RAM hardware problem, which is not
impossible. I think these machines were bought while still in beta-test,
and hopefully, Compaq will drop by tomorrow to have a look. 

Best,

Dear all,

Uwe e-mailed me yesterday about the problems some time ago. I had hoped
someone would have a look at our computers, but due to some unfortunate
circumstances, it hasn't happened. However, it seems unlikely that it is
connected to a specific piece of hardware. It could be an
architecture-dependent problem though. I also had a word with those who
did the installation of R, and they had some problems when tuning it for
alphaev6, but it all went smoothly when tuning for alphaev56, and that is
the build I'm running. This is basically the stuff I sent to Uwe
yesterday. 

I have been testing it on three different machines:
alnair, a XP1000 with a 500MHz alphaev6 processor and 619 MB RAM
rukbat, a PWS500au with a 500MHz alphaev56 processor with 238 MB RAM
mirfak, a DEC255/233 with a 233MHz (?) alphaev4 (?) processor with 245MB
(RAM is according to top). All show the same problems consistently. 
I'm not using the match.arg()-approach anymore, BTW, I have moved on to
some object-oriented stuff. 

However, some apparently related (?) problem occurs. Yesterday, I started
working on some simulations I have done (with R of course! :-) ). I did
exactly the same operations on rukbat and mirfak (using ESS-elsewhere
while sitting on alnair), starting with the same calls, vsize=80M,
nsize=800k, no-restore. I loaded a 58MB file with load, and there are a
few variables with arrays of htest-objects. Then, I did 
as.vector(sapply(chisq5M11000, function(x) x$statistic))
to get a vector of the test statistics. Now, occasionally, it prints a
nice vector with all the values intact. Occasionally, one of the entries
are NULL, and then it prints a list, e.g.
[[892]]
X-squared 
 1933.637 

[[893]]
NULL

[[894]]
X-squared 
 1741.416 

The funny thing is that when I did this sapply thing on mirfak and rukbat,
it happened on at exactly the same place on the two machines. First,
mirfak would produce a vector then rukbat would produce a vector, mirfak
would give a list where element # 238 (if I remember correctly) was NULL,
rukbat would produce a list with element #238 NULL, both would produce a
vector again, both would produce a list with element #602 NULL, etc... 

This is pretty much what I've got now... :-)

Best,

Kjetil

Now, since  help(lm.fit) and help(lm.wfit) really do not contain any
information on these, one could argue that the above is not a bug.

However as build blocks for programming (many regressions),
these functions *should* work reasonably generally.

(I'm trying to fix this bug myself).

Dear R team,

If I may offer some suggestions for specific help screens:

1.
help(plot.default):  shouldn't `type = "n"' be listed as a possible value?

also, would it be better to say, e.g., "the following values (rather than
'possibilities') are possible" ?

2.
help(glm) data: misprint (ffrom)

    data: an optional data frame containing the variables in the model.
           By default the variables are taken from the environment
          ffrom which `glm' is called.
         ^^^

3. 
help(all):  might it be helpful to add:

  "see also `any'"

and,

help(any)

  "see also `all'"  ?

Many thanks!

Rashid Nassar

dotplot() colors are plotted (probably unintentionally?) in reverse order.

x <- c(rep(1,3),rep(2,3),rep(3,3))
dotplot(x,groups=factor(x),col=x)        # 1 plotted with col=3, etc.

Thank you very much.

Yes. This is caused by 

        o <- rev(order(as.numeric(groups)))
        x <- x[o]
        groups <- groups[o]

and no corresponding reordering of color. A little care is needed when
fixing this since color is not necessarily a vector. Same thing with
lcolor, by the way.

I think there's at least another (maybe the only one) bug in main/graphics.c
which is not related to postscript at all, see below.

    Jim> producing a solid line when all elements of 'ltyarray' are zero.

yes, but I think this shouldn't be necessary.

The real bug is uglier:
If you use something like   par(lty="1")  
or any other one-letter (hex digit) string,
this leads to an invalid `code', and further, the storage location 
(such dd->lty in C) of that string somehow loses it's final string
terminator (\0 in C) and gets mangled.
I can reproduce this most easily with the following


for(i in seq(along=dev.list())) dev.off()
par(lty="1")

Labels created with expression seem to disappear, e.g. the x axis label in

x <- -6:16
contour(outer(x, x), method = "edge", vfont = c("sans serif", "plain"),
xlab=expression(theta[0]), ylab=expression(theta[1]))

and all three labels in

x <- -6:16
persp(outer(x, x), xlab=expression(theta[0]), ylab=expression(theta[1]),
zlab=expression(theta[2]), ticktype="detailed")


Is this just a clipping problem, with a large bounding box for expression=...?

No. It's a bug in the C code.

It was reported and fixed last week, so it should be fixed in
R-patched on CRAN.

Actually, it was only reported and fixed for two-d plots. It is probably
still broken for persp()

Under Windows, system.file() can return a path with both / and \\
characters (R 1.0.0)
eg
> system.file("libs",pkg="modreg")
"C:\\PROGRA~1\\R\\rw1000/library/modreg/libs"

This is fine when passed to R functions but not when passed to eg Tcl.

Yes, but the bug is in TCL, not R!  Such paths are valid paths on Windows,
with \ being preferred, but TCL does not accept paths containing \, which I
find pretty amazing.  I am not sure it handles drives properly, either.

In a few cases / or \ is required, so you will see gsub used quite
frequently in Windows R code.

Hi,

  After the installation I can't search, clicking on "Search Engine &
  Keywords" gives me a 404, file not found.  I can concatenate 
  SearchEngine-head and -foot.html into SearchEngine.html which allows
  me to search, but I'm missing the key words.
  Finally the question:  What happened that SearchEngine.html is not
  generated at install time?  

  Thanks,

P.S.  I quickly checked "?bug.report" to see its options.  The doc
    contains the "method" and "address" twice.  Do you want something
    trivial like this reported thru bug.report or is there another channel?
    Do you have a severity option for bug.reports?

There was a bug (already fixed in the patched release version) which
did not install SearchEngine.html (though it was built) when the build
directory was not the src directory.

If you did compile R yourself, could you get R-patched from CRAN and
see if the problem still exists?

The channel is correct.

Not yet.
