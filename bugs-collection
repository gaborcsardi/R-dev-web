There seems to be a bug with var() when the argument is a vector with
exactly three values of 1e30 (or close to this value). This does not happen
with twice, four (or more) times this value, or another value.

The bug is repeatable, and I got the same results with R 1.3.1 (binary from
CRAN) and R 1.4.0 (binary from BD Ripley's site) both on Windows NT, and R
1.4.0 on Solaris (compiled from sources).

Not a bug, roundoff:

> (1e30+1e30+1e30)/3-1e30
[1] 1.407375e+14
> 3*((1e30+1e30+1e30)/3-1e30)^2/2
[1] 2.971056e+28

Relative errors of the order 1e-16 are completely expectable in
floating point arithmetic.

For illustration, look at it in octal, after removing a bunch of
trailing zeroes:

> x<-1e30/(8^16)
> structure(x, class="octmode")
[1] "144762623464043165"
> structure(x+x+x, class="octmode")
[1] "456730272634151540"

If you look carefully, you will see that a bit is lost in the process
since 5+5+5 is 17 octal.

But there are better algorithms that are not subject to this sort
of rounding error.

I reckon that computing a variance this way is not the quality of
algorithm one should expect from R.

Hmm. Which algorithms are there? Surely almost any kind of provisional
means subtraction could avoid the the extreme case where the mean of a
bunch of identical numbers is different from all of them, but will it
also improve precision in the general case?

Essentially our current algorithm in cov.c is

xm<- sum(x)/n
v <- 1/(n-1)*sum((x-xm)^2)

Subject: Bug in rnorm.


There appears to be a mild bug, or at least a deficiency, in
rnorm.  The bug becomes apparent when one looks at extremes
of the squares of the values generated by rnorm; rnorm is not
generating quite enough extreme values.

The R version that I am using is 1.4.1; I never got around to installing
1.5.0, and now since 1.5.1 is about to come out ....  However, checking
the 1.5.0 release notes revealed no mention of fixing a bug in rnorm.

Version details:

os       solaris2.7

month    01                  
day      30                  
language R

More detail regarding how the bug revealed itself:
==================================================

	For n = 100, 200, ..., 1500

	o I generated 1000 sequences of length n via rnorm(n),

	o for each sequence x, I calculated m = the max of x^2

	o I then calculated pval = 1 - pchisq(m,1)^n

	o I then calculated s.hat.n = #{pval: pval < 0.05}/1000

I then plotted s.hat.n versus n.  This ***should*** give a result
close to a horizontal straight line, at height 0.05 --- but it
didn't.  For the larger values of n, the values of s.hat.n were
displaced significantly below 0.05.

After some discussion with colleagues, I replaced the calls to rnorm()
by calls to myrnorm() defined by

	myrnorm <- function(n,mu=0,sigma=1){
		mu + sigma*cos(2*pi*runif(n))*sqrt(-2*log(runif(n)))
	}

which uses the ``(r,theta)'' method of generating random normals.

When I did so, the resulting values were indeed all ``close to'' 0.05,
as they should be.

I also tried the experiment using rchisq(n,1) instead of rnorm(n) (and
then of course taking m = max of x --- rather than max of x^2).  Again
all the resulting values were close to 0.05 as ought to be the case.
(So rchisq() appears to be OK in this regard.)

Enclosed below is a script to demonstrate the bug.

Also qnorm(runif(n)) seems to be closer to the target.

No I do not! My quick check code took the square of the max rather
than the max of the square...

With your script, I get a nice horizontal line both with 1.4.0 and
1.5.0-patched.

I get what Rolf described in 1.5.0-patched for Windows with the
default generators: 

RNGkind()
[1] "Marsaglia-Multicarry" "Kinderman-Ramage"  

I switched to the Ahrens-Dieter normal RNG (using
RNGkind(,'Ahrens-Dieter')), and things were fine.  

Keeping the default normal generator but switching to the
Mersenne-Twister uniform also fixed it:

> RNGkind()

Is it possible you're not using the default generators?  If you are,
this is quite weird, because we're on the same hardware.  Why would
the OS or compiler matter in a calculation like this??

R supplies a choice of random-number generators as well as a choice of
generating normals.  All methods are compromises, and I suspect one of the
non-default ones may be better for your purposes.  Please investigate the
choices.

Now this is pretty darn odd....

This is what happened to me yesterday with 1.4.0:

[Previously saved workspace restored]

> m <- sapply(1:1000, function(i)max(rnorm(1500)^2))
> sum( 1 - pchisq(m,1)^1500 < .05)

> m <- sapply(1:1000, function(i)max(rnorm(1500)^2))
> sum( 1 - pchisq(m,1)^1500 < .05)
[1] 51

This morning, I get

> RNGkind()
[1] "Marsaglia-Multicarry" "Kinderman-Ramage"    
> m <- sapply(1:1000, function(i)max(rnorm(1500)^2))

> m <- sapply(1:1000, function(i)max(rnorm(1500)^2))
> sum( 1 - pchisq(m,1)^1500 < .05)
[1] 29

with the SAME version of R. The only difference is the startup
directory, and hence the saved workspace. This contains:

> ls(all=T)
[1] ".Random.seed" "x"            "y"           
> .Random.seed
[1]     0 25300 11635 10783

..whereas 1.5.0 which now again shows trouble has

>  .Random.seed
[1]         1 196857153 319227924

and 1.4.0 in a clean dir has this after a few iterations of the above

>  .Random.seed
[1]          1 1297109091   47580530


Oho! I think I get it: the "1" in the seed actually *defines* the RNG,
no matter what RNGkind() is telling me??

non-numeric argument to a binary vector in one of three nearly identical
uses.

Error in Inh/Ki : non-numeric argument to binary operator

(Inh and Ki are arguments to the function used in the formula for the
object whose predictions were requested).

It turns out that the problem is in getCovariateFormula().

The final line in getCovariateFormula() in the nlme package (version
3.1-16) is:
    eval(parse(text = paste("~", deparse(form))))

however, if deparse(form) exceeds 'width.cutoff (which defaults to 60)',
this results in inappropriately placed "~" signs:
For example, in my application with the error, form is

UnCompetitive(MethoxyresorufinConc, InhibitorConc, Vmax, Km, Ki)

the result of the paste() operation in the last line of getCovariateFormula
is:

> paste("~",deparse(form))
[1] "~ UnCompetitive(MethoxyresorufinConc, InhibitorConc, Vmax, Km, "
[2] "~     Ki)"

extending width.cutoff gives the intended value:

> paste("~",deparse(form,width.cutoff=500))
[1] "~ UnCompetitive(MethoxyresorufinConc, InhibitorConc, Vmax, Km, Ki)"

Seems a bit risky for an enforced cutoff in deparse, though.

parse(...deparse(...)) always looks wrong to me anyway. Couldn't one
use something like

f <- ~1
f[[2]] <- form
eval(f)

or 

eval(as.call(list(as.name("~"),form)))

or

eval(substitute(~form)) # that's not going to work in S, though...

??

(What is the eval for? Doesn't usually do anything to a
formula argument.)

Exactly.  The code was originally written for S and ported to R.  Some
of the contorted expressions were things that we found by
experimentation would work in both systems.

In Sv3 at least it assigns a class to the object.

I'll change it to eval(substitute(~form)) for the R package.

It looks clunky, but you could maintain consistency across S and R forms
with

eval(parse(text=paste("~",paste(deparse(form),collapse=" "))))

Aha. In R too.

Great. I would have thought that one of the two other forms would be
portable, though.

There is a bug in the polymars code.  

Line 655   m=m+k-1;

ought to be moved in front of the for loop in line 652 or else the levels array
will go out of bounds in the loop.

This does not seem to cause any errors in R, but caused crashes when I attempted
to link the file to PV-wave.

This could be a bug in the e1071 svm code, but maybe not -- I guess I'll
send it here anyway. It's reproducible.

not really reproducible:

1) If you use random data (which is perfect),
  you need an explicit  set.seed(.) statement to make it reproducible

2) I can evaluate the code below (intel-Linux as you)
    more than 100 times without a problem.

Which version of e1071 are you using (Current: 1.2-1)? This package had
a bug fix release one month ago.

To follow up on this (yes, I'm using 1.2-1), here is the backtrace. Hope
it helps.

Subject: pixmap: infinite recursion with nonascii pnm-files
To: r-bugs@r-project.org
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/plain; charset=us-ascii

Problem:

read.pnm from pixmap_0.2-1.tar.gz stops with an infinite recursion if a
"#" occurs within the raw (binary) data of a pnm-file.


The reason for this behaviour seems to be the handling of comments in
read.pnmhead. The recursive call of strip.comments requires a newline to
complete sucessfully. A work-around would be

diff -r pixmap/R/pnm.R pixmap.orig/R/pnm.R
112c112
<       com1 <- as.integer(regexpr("#.*\n", inpstr))
---
>       com1 <- as.integer(regexpr("#", inpstr))

i.e. to check if the comment sign is actually followed by a newline.

However, if this sequence (#.*\n) would occur within the data and within
the first 350 bytes of the pnm-file the data would be stripped as well.

Furthermore, comments within the data of ascii files after byte 350 are
not handled correctly and lead to an error. Although this seems to be a
rare case, it might occur and it is allowed by the pnm-file
specification.

  A couple of minor points about the odesolve package
(which I am otherwise enjoying very much):

 1. "scalar" is misspelled as "scaler" in the definitions of
the rtol and atol parameters

 2. it is possible to crash R by doing something dumb, e.g
failing to read the documentation carefully enough and (a)
returning only a vector of derivatives and not a list of
(derivatives, global values) and (b) making the derivative
vector shorter than the vector of initial conditions (see example below).

  I know that this is my fault, but it might be possible/useful
to "user-proof" lsoda() some more (try func() once and see if
it returns a list of the appropriate form, check the derivative
vector for length matching the IC vector, etc ...

tderiv <- function(t,x,parms) {
#  return(list(c(x[1]*parms[1],x[2]*parms[2],parms[3]*(x[1]+x[2])),NULL))
   return(c(x[1]*parms[1],x[2]*parms[2],parms[3]*(x[1]+x[2])))
}

lsoda(rep(1,2),c(0:20),tderiv,c(0.01,-0.01,1.2))

Probably r-devel is not the right place for this discussion, since
odesolve is not an "official" part of R (not even a recommended
package).  I'll respond here to get it in the record, though.  I expect
to have a new release of odesolve ready in a couple of weeks.  lsoda
already calls func() once, to determine the number of "extra" values
returned; it was foolish of me not to test for the kind of value
returned at the same time.  That fix is already in the next release.
I'll see what other defensive checking can be done, as well.
Thanks for the spelling correction.

  A couple of minor points about the odesolve package
(which I am otherwise enjoying very much):

 1. "scalar" is misspelled as "scaler" in the definitions of
the rtol and atol parameters

 2. it is possible to crash R by doing something dumb, e.g
failing to read the documentation carefully enough and (a)
returning only a vector of derivatives and not a list of
(derivatives, global values) and (b) making the derivative
vector shorter than the vector of initial conditions (see example
below).

  I know that this is my fault, but it might be possible/useful
to "user-proof" lsoda() some more (try func() once and see if
it returns a list of the appropriate form, check the derivative
vector for length matching the IC vector, etc ...

tderiv <- function(t,x,parms) {
#  return(list(c(x[1]*parms[1],x[2]*parms[2],parms[3]*(x[1]
+x[2])),NULL))
   return(c(x[1]*parms[1],x[2]*parms[2],parms[3]*(x[1]+x[2])))
}

lsoda(rep(1,2),c(0:20),tderiv,c(0.01,-0.01,1.2))

Hi,
   Recently we did some benchmarks regarding matrix inverse operation and found
some strange things. See the following results (the package Matrix is most
updated).

1. load the function Toeplitz and library(Matrix)
"Toeplitz"
function(x)
{
        matrix(x[1 + abs(outer(seq(along = x), seq(along = x), FUN = "-"))], 
                byrow = T, ncol = length(x))
}
2. On a PIII 1.125GHz (256kb cache)desktop PC with win2k, the results are
> system.time(solve(Toeplitz(.5^seq(0,999))))
[1] 38.25  0.22 42.01    NA    NA
> system.time(solve.Matrix(Toeplitz(.5^seq(0,999))))
[1] 28.01  0.17 30.94    NA    NA

On a PIII-M 1.2GHz (512kb cache) laptop PC with winxp pro, the results are
> system.time(solve(Toeplitz(.5^seq(0,999))))
[1] 33.94  0.25 34.01    NA    NA
> system.time(solve.Matrix(Toeplitz(.5^seq(0,999))))
[1] 9.40  0.13 9.54    NA    NA

On a PIII Xeon 1GHz (256kb cache) RedHat 7.2 Linux, the results are
> system.time(solve(Toeplitz(.5^seq(0,999))))
[1] 53.79  0.48 00.01    NA    NA
> system.time(solve.Matrix(Toeplitz(.5^seq(0,999))))
[1] 30.29  0.21 30.59    NA    NA

This was the first time that windows R outperformed linux R even PIII Xeon 1GHz
is slightly faster than PIII 1.125GHz. Notice the abnormal result 9.4s from
PIII-M 1.2GHz (cannot be three times faster). After using native fortran lapack
(call to dpotrf and dpotri returns 9s for PIII Xeon), I realized that R may
treat the matrix as a general matrix rather than symmetric except the abnormal
case.  To confirm this, I modified the R_LapackPP.cc in Matrix package and it
turned out that
    is.MMatrix() failed to return true.
Hence 
        if (checkClass(classes, "Hermitian")) 
            return new LaSymmMatDouble(x);
is not executed in static LaMatDouble* asLaMatrix(SEXP x). Instead
    if (isMatrix(x)) {
            return new LaGenMatDouble(x);  
        }
is used. 
After replaced
    return new LaGenMatDouble(x);   
with 
    return new LaSymmMatDouble(x);

the result was (PIII Xeon 1GHz RedHat 7.2 Linux))
> system.time(solve.Matrix(Toeplitz(.5^seq(0,999))))
[1] 9.76 0.22 9.97 0.00 0.00

Clearly there are some bugs in solve() and solve.Matrix(). Notice that all have
> is.Hermitian(Toeplitz(.5^seq(0,999)))
[1] TRUE


Thanks

Nothing in this report suggests a bug in solve().  Can you please provide
some evidence for your claim (which is not `clear' to me), and

> solve
function (a, b, ...)
UseMethod("solve")

seems hard to get wrong!  (It matters: solve is part of R: solve.Matrix is
a contributed addon.)

Incidentally, these sort of timings are crucially dependent on the BLAS
library used, and in my experience that is a far larger factor that the OS
used.  However, that was not part of the report ....

I have apparently found an error in the "pam" function of the "cluster"
library package.  Please pardon me if this error has been pointed out or
if this e-mail should be directed to someone else.

The problem only started occurring with R version 1.5.0, which I started
using about a week ago.  The problem occurs when you try to use "pam"
with the input being a dissimilarity matrix instead of a data matrix;
the results when using the dissimilarity matrix are very strange and not
at all like those obtained when using the data matrix.

For example, try this code:

library(cluster)
data(ruspini)
#the clustering using a data matrix as the input:
pam(ruspini,4)
#the clustering using a dissimilarity matrix as input:
pam(daisy(ruspini),4,diss=T)

The clustering results should be the same but are wildly different.
Again, this problem started happening with the upgrade to R 1.5.0.
Thank you for any help you can provide.

David Hitchcock

    DavidH> The clustering results should be the same but are wildly different.

well, "wildly different" is an  ``unusual''  description of

   > daisy(ruspini)
   Error in daisy(ruspini) : NAs in foreign function call (arg 7)

which does happen when  library(methods)  is attached (as it is
for me)  
and  is not new in 1.5.0, (it does happen in the 1.4.x versions
as well, because since then, read.table() does not coerce
integer to numeric anymore).

This is clearly an omission in daisy() which only checks for "numeric"
instead of "integer" as well.

Can you make sure you detach methods, e.g., by

    if(any(i.meth <- search() == "package:methods")) detach(i.meth)

and retry then. For me the result is then almost identical
(apart from the fact that in the 2nd case the medoid coordinates are
 not available, of course!)

    DavidH> Again, this problem started happening with the upgrade to R 1.5.0.

(but not from 1.4.x ...)

Thanks for reporting.

Just for the record:
  repeat try(fisher.test(d4))
results in a crash after a few iterations (R-1.5.0 patched on WinNT
4.0).

This occurred because integer overflow was giving negative keys.

Append the following line at line 1083 of fexact.c

      if (ipn < 1) ipn += ldst; /* because key might be negative */

That one is easy:  You (MM) have calculated fact[2], but fact is only of
length 2 (for values 0 and 1), so ico gets overwritten.

I now suspect that my fix for the original bug is merely a fix for a
symptom, so am going to replace it by an error message.

in e0171 the routine rdiscrete fails when n==1

the first few lines of code make it obvious why

function (n, probs, values = 1:length(probs), method = "inverse", 
    aliasmatrix = NULL) 
{
    if (length(probs) != length(values)) 
        stop("rdiscrete: probs and values must have the same 
length.")

    if (n == 1) 
        return(values[sum(runif(1) > p) + 1])   ???? p is undefined at 
this point
    else {

Full_Name: Jarno Tuimala
Version: 1.5.0
OS: Windows Nt
Submission from: (NULL) (193.166.1.21)


Running the following analysis gives as a result kukot vs. kisut.

aikaero <- -27.5+5*(0:10)
frekvenssi.m <- c(0,1,15,37,53,45,23,18,4,1,1)
frekvenssi.n <- c(2,8,12,19,33,47,42,15,2,1,0)
win.graph()
aikaero <- rep(c(aikaero,aikaero), c(frekvenssi.m,frekvenssi.n))
 a.ero <- data.frame(aikaero,
            sukupuoli=rep(c("kukot","kisut"),
                          c(sum(frekvenssi.m),sum(frekvenssi.n))))
    qq(sukupuoli ~ aikaero, data=a.ero)

However, running the following analysis, gives miehet vs. miehet.

 aikaero <- -27.5+5*(0:10)
 frekvenssi.m <- c(0,1,15,37,53,45,23,18,4,1,1)
 frekvenssi.n <- c(2,8,12,19,33,47,42,15,2,1,0)
 win.graph()
 aikaero <- rep(c(aikaero,aikaero), c(frekvenssi.m,frekvenssi.n))
 a.ero <- data.frame(aikaero,
        sukupuoli=rep(c("miehet","naiset"),
                      c(sum(frekvenssi.m),sum(frekvenssi.n))))
     qq(sukupuoli ~ aikaero, data=a.ero)

This seems to happen everytime "sukupuoli" contains one variable name, which
starts with a letter "n". If both names start with "n" or other letters the
results is miehet vs naiset as expected.

So this works fine:

a.ero <- data.frame(aikaero,
        sukupuoli=rep(c("nisset","naiset"),
                      c(sum(frekvenssi.m),sum(frekvenssi.n))))
     qq(sukupuoli ~ aikaero, data=a.ero)

And this also:

a.ero <- data.frame(aikaero,
        sukupuoli=rep(c("miehet","maiset"),
                      c(sum(frekvenssi.m),sum(frekvenssi.n))))
     qq(sukupuoli ~ aikaero, data=a.ero)

Where's the problem?

1) This is a report on the lattice package, and we both need you to
mention that and to give the version number of lattice that you used
to be sure of beeing able to reproduce this.

2) It seems that the plots are actually correct, just the labels are
wrong. You can correct that by specifying xlab and ylab in the call.

3) The error appears to be a typo:

    if (missing(ylab))
        ylab <- if (is.f.y)
            unique(levels(y))[y]
        else paste("y:", as.character(unique(levels(y)[[2]])))

should be [2] for consistency.

is not passed explicitely. Below a suggested patch 

Suggestions for patches are in the archives, by Thomas Lumley and saikat.

Both are essentially correct, but probably untested (typos).

Subject: nlme: failed augPred with NA in an unused column

Full_Name: Dieter Menne
Version: 1.5.1
OS: win2000
Submission from: (NULL) (212.185.252.139)


nlme Version: 3.1-27

gsummary fails if any of the columns contains an NA.

 varying <- unlist(lapply(object, function(column, frst) {
        aux <- as.character(column)
        any(aux != aux[frst])
    }, frst = asFirst))
>>    if (any(varying) && (!invariantsOnly)) {

Error in if (any(varying) && (!invariantsOnly)) { : 
        missing value where logical needed

This probably is by design (an more verbose error message would help),
but as a consequence augPred also fails even if
the column is not used at all in the fit.
  
------------------------------------------------
library(nlme)
data(Orthodont)
# add a column with an NA that is not used in the fit
Orthodont$Others<-runif(nrow(Orthodont))
is.na(Orthodont$Others[3])<-T
fm1 <- lme(Orthodont, random = ~1)
augPred(fm1, length.out = 2, level = c(0,1))

#Error in if (any(varying) && (!invariantsOnly)) { :

Which compiler is this?

I have no problems with svm() on RH7.2 compiling with either gcc 3.1 or
gcc 2.95.3: Red Hat make a habit of supplying unreleased (and buggy)
versions of gcc. I think this is particularly critical when C/C++ mixtures
are used (as in svm).

PR#1178 is another non-reproducible segfault in svm on Linux.

I've used the stock 2.96 gcc. Also I have 3.1 installed as gcc3 but
couldn't get around to make R compile with gcc3.

Thanks

Thank you for the hint.
I rebuild gcc and R from scratch and now it works. Here's how on RH7.3,
which might help others:

configured gcc with: --enable-languages=c,c++,objc,f77
--program-suffix=3 --prefix=/usr

in config.site for R the following variables are then set:
CC=gcc3
F77=f773
CXX=g++3
LDFLAGS=-L/usr/lib/gcc-lib/i686-pc-linux-gnu/3.1
-L/usr/lib/gcc-lib/i686-pc-linux-gnu

Thank you very much again.

Best wishes,

	Stefan

It *is* reproducible on another stock RH7.3, though. I might try
digging a little deeper when I recover from the NY/Boston meetings.

I asked Prof. Brian Ripley if I might submit some text/input for the
R-intro writers, he said this is the place to do it.

I was on a plane a couple of weeks ago reading R-intro as I plan for a
course and made these notes, some of which I think will help my students
if you incorporate them.  I've attached a raw text file I wrote in Emacs
to this message "Rintrochanges.txt".

I have written documents like R-intro before and understand it is
difficult to please everybody, and I thank you for your effort on the
project.

R-intro comments/enhancements  Part I.

I think something more verbose like this would help under
"Ordered and Unordered factors"

Texts on research design emphasize that variables have
different levels of measurement. Typically, there are three levels.
If a measurement is taken with a precise scale (one on which it is
meaningful to say new_value = b*old_value, as with readings of a
thermometer), it is considered an "interval" level variable.  Many
statistical models were originally designed for interval level
variables.  If a measurement is not so precise, but only provides an
ordered categorization of observations, such as "low" "medium" and
"high", it is called an ordinal variable.  If a measurement is
categorical and implies no sense of ordering, such as "European",
"Asian", or "South American", then it is typically called an ordinal
variable.  Assigning the values of "1", "2", and "3" to these
observations has no substantive significance, as we might as well
number them "3","2","1".

Many statistical models are designed for interval level data, but with
appropriate recoding of input, they can also be made to work with
nominal and ordinal data.  In the "old days" of statistical computing,
users were forced to create a lot of indicator (or "dummy") variables,
thereby converting information from nominal or ordinal measurements
into variables that have only values 0 and 1.  For example, to
represent the information about the home continents of survey
respondents, we might create two dummy variables, one for Asia (coded
1 if respondent is from Asia, 0 otherwise) and one for South America
(likewise 0 and 1).  A respondent for whom we find both of these dummy
variables equal to 0 is sure to be from Europe, so we don't usually
need to create three dummy variables.  Doing so would be redundant.

With a modern language like R, much of the drudgery of creating the
indicator variables is handled automatically if the user declares the
variables properly.  In R, and S before it, the term "factor" is used
to refer to a variable that is not measured at the interval level. An
"unordered factor" is a nominal (or categorical) variable, while an
"ordered factor" is the term for an ordinal measurement.  Many
statistical procedures in R have builtin procedures for handling
factors.

Beyond handling coding of noninterval variables, factors play a vital
role in many R procedures.  Procedures can be designed to do a chore
for each value of a factor.  Many procedures will in fact insist that
a variable be designated as a factor.

 ------------------


In this section "Named arguments and defaults", I am left in a
confusion about a few things.  This confusion has bothered me a while.
Can you do more to explain which arguments must be specified, which
are optional, and under what conditions is it necessary to include the
parameter= which calling a function.

1.  When I use a function, and I look in its help page, how do I know
which input variables must be declared and which can be ignored?  This
is quite mysterious.  When invocations leave out some arguments, how
does R "sift through" the ones that are provided to know which is
which?


For example, consider the page on "update.packages".  

Under Usage, I find:
update.packages(lib.loc = .lib.loc, CRAN = getOption("CRAN"),
                contriburl = contrib.url(CRAN),
                method = "auto", instlib = NULL,
                ask=TRUE, available=NULL, destdir=NULL)

I've been using computers a long time, and I use this function every two months or so.  Between times I forget, come back to this page, and still this one leaves me totally confused.  

After fiddling a while, I find this works on Linux:
>update.packages(lib="/usr/lib/R/library",CRAN="http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/R/CRAN")

but what bothered me thd most is the "getOption("CRAN") option for CRAN.  I tried many variations on that and never figured how to make it work.


Maybe any clarifications could be related to the section "Getting help with functions and features"

In this section, I think it would be nice to have a paragraph about
"how to read a help page."  Some things are not obvious to all new
users.  Some things in help pages are tough to describe... Maybe I'd
say

How to read a help page.

If you find a help page, notice that it is made up of different parts.

1. "Description". These are usually terse, so read every word
   carefully.

2. Look for the "Value" heading.  That tells you what this procedure is
   going to return when you call it. If this procedure doesn't return
   what you need, you should find out immediately.

3. Under "Usage", most help pages list a number of possible commands
   that can be used.  These are not commands to be typed
   literally. Many of them contain abstract references which provide
   information about the nature of the variables that might be
   entered.  

   Here is a simple case.  The coefficients help page has this:

Usage

coef(object, ...)
coefficients(object, ...)

   Clearly, coef and coefficients are going to do the same thing, and you must supply the appropriate object.

4. Under "Arguments," the help page indicates what inputs this
   procedure wants.  The inputs are described line-by-line, and often
   the comments indicate of parameters are optional or what their
   default value might be.

   Many help pages have the infamous "...", which is something like
   "fill in the appropriately, depending on whatever context you
   find."  In some situations this is easy to understand .  Many help
   pages will eplicitly say that "..." refers to any options that
   might be used with a particular kind of object, and in that case
   one must find the help page for that other object. For example, the
   dev.copy help page clearly indicates that "..." refers to any
   options that might be used with the particular device in question.

   Other help pages are not so informative.  Consider the output from ?coefficients:

Arguments

 object
       an object for which the extraction of model coefficients is meaningful.
 ...
       other arguments.

Here it is clear you need to give a statistical object to have
coefficients removed.  The "..." is a mystery, and most R users will
try to use the coefficients command without worrying about it, and
then backtrack if an error occurs.  And, if an error occurs, there may be no recourse but to read the source code for this command or ask  about it in the r-help email list.

Brian Ripley said that, if I sent these here, they might find their way
to the R-intro team.  So, here is another installment:


Concerning this section:

Data permanency and removing objects.

This is the first place R-intro discusses objects.  I was thinking a
better discussion of objects and syntax is needed, perhaps here, or in
the later section "Objects, their modes and attributes."  I suggest
this:


The fact that R is an object-oriented approach to programming for
statistical analysis has pervasive implications.  If one has studied a
programming language like Java or C++, the notions of object and
method are not new.  For readers who have not studied languages like
that, perhaps we can offer a brief explanation.  An object is a "self
contained data holder" that can follow instructions (do calculations,
provide values).  One intention of this design is to keep things
separate if they belong that way, to reduce the risk that one
calculation accidentally influences the result of another.
Object-orientation also has important implications for the way the
different parts of a program fit together.  Since an object is
supposed to be able to carry out a certain set of actions (which are
called methods, but in R one often says "functions" or "procedures"),
then both the user and the programmer understand what the object can
be expected to do.  There are numerous implications of object
orientation that come into play "under the hood" of the R statistical
engine, but it is not important to delve into them from a user's point
of view.


There is one wrinkle about the syntax of R that we hasten to
emphasize.  In object-oriented computer languages, syntax typically
puts the object first, followed by the instruction, followed any needed
parameters.  In Java, to tell the object "regression" to calculate
estimates for vectors y and x, one would write something like:

   regression.estimate(y,x);

Assuming that object's class has an "estimate" method which knows how
to handle the input, we would be in business.

In R, the syntax is totally different.  Instead of thinking of the
object itself as the primary thing, the syntax in R is designed to use
the method name--the instruction--as the leading concept, and then the
object that is being acted upon is given as a parameter.

When a model gives a result in R, the result is almost invariably an
object, which can then be "poked and prodded" with other methods.
If a linear regression is calculated, for example:

resultObject <- lm(y~x)

the return value is an object.  But, unlike other object-oriented
languages, in R one would write summary(resultObject), or
coefficients(resultObject), rather than the Java style
result_object.summary() or some such thing, in order to investigate the
result.

  There appears to be a mismatch between the documentation and behavior of
title(), or at least a clarification is in order.  The documentation says
you can pass extra arguments from par() as "...".  However, cex at least
is ignored. Later on in the documentation it becomes clear that you can
specify these extra parameters as part of a list.

  I wouldn't say this is necessarily a bug (and there's certainly a way to
do what you want, if you read the rest of the documentation), but I will
say it didn't seem to follow the same conventions as most of the rest of
the graphical annotation in R.  I would have expected
title(main="foo",cex=2) to set the title larger ...

  I think it would be nicer if title() worked this way, but if it doesn't
it would be nice to have an additional note in the documentation for "..."
to the effect that parameters such as cex, col, etc., should be set using
the list mechanism described below.

## setting parameter with par(): works
par(mfrow=c(3,3),cex=1)
for (i in 1:9) {
  plot(0:5)
  par(cex=i)
  title(main="hello")
  par(cex=1)
}

## passing parameter as part of a list: works
par(mfrow=c(3,3),cex=1)
for (i in 1:9) {
  plot(0:5)
  title(main=list("hello",cex=i))
  par(cex=1)
}

## passing cex as an additional arg: doesn't work
par(mfrow=c(3,3))
for (i in 1:9) {
  plot(0:5)
  title(main="hello",cex=i)
}

No bug.  Here's the clarification:

Contrary to the other implementations of S,
R differentiates different usages of "cex", "col" and "font" :

 > .Pars[grep("^cex",.Pars)]
 [1] "cex"      "cex.axis" "cex.lab"  "cex.main" "cex.sub" 
 > .Pars[grep("^col",.Pars)]
 [1] "col"      "col.axis" "col.lab"  "col.main" "col.sub" 
 > .Pars[grep("^font",.Pars)]
 [1] "font"      "font.axis" "font.lab"  "font.main" "font.sub" 

and ?par *does* document this.

Hence the "..." in axis() should really be ``filled'' with cex.axis, etc.

The following is an example demonstrating R's possibilities 
    (not as cleanly possible in S-plus AFAIK):

plot(1, col.axis = "sky blue", col.lab = "thistle")
title("Main Title", sub = "sub title", 
      cex.main = 2,   font.main= 4, col.main= "blue",
      cex.sub = 0.75, font.sub = 3, col.sub = "red")

I have a small request re.

R FAQ
Frequently Asked Questions on R
Version 1.5-10, 2002-06-13
ISBN 3-901167-51-X
Kurt Hornik


In section 6.2 Should I run R from within Emacs? The faq says

"Yes, definitely." 

This led me to install emacs, and to install ess. However, I use a windows
environment (mswindows2000) and I had some difficulty installing, linking
and launching these applications. After several hours I had launched emacs
but had failed to link it with either ess or r, partly because of platform
problems. (As a dedicated windows user, I am reluctant to tinker with
autoexec.bat and the like).

I spent several hours doing this, and in hindsight, I decided to uninstall
emacs and ess.
 
I would prefer if the faq could be changed to say:

"This is optional."

And perhaps some comment could be made about platforms. I found the
documentation for emacs and ess to be a bit of a hair-pulling exercise. NOT
one of the "plug and play" applications that MS windows is so fond of! 

By the way, I like the r gui very much. I used splus for some time as a PhD
student, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that my scripts run in r!! I
intend to use r from now onwards, and to encourage my colleagues to use it
too.

Full_Name: Bill Simpson
Version: 64.1

Submission from: (NULL) (193.62.250.209)


Bug in persp() bounding box:
If the surface being plotted extends below the lower z-axis boundary, the box
is
drawn with the wrong occlusion. The box is shown as being occluded by the
surface
even though it should be in front of the surface.

The box is correct for surface extending above the box. Problem is only for
surface extending below the box.

This exhibits the bug:

R 1.1.1 on Windows, but I think this is widespread.

Using either

par(cex=0.5)
plot(1:10)
identify(1:10)

or

plot(1:10)
identify(1:10, cex=0.5)

ignores the cex setting.  The root cause is that par(cex=0.5)
alters cexbase for the device but sets cex=1.0, and the internal
text plotting routines use cex and not cexbase.

The obvious fix is to set cex to cexbase in do_identify. However,
if this is fixed, there is another problem, The offset of the label
is related to the cex in use for the label, and not for the symbol.
So

plot(1:10, type="n")
points(1:10, cex=5)
identify(1:10)

is not sensible in placing the labels.  That may be hard to anticipate,
but 

plot(1:10)
identify(1:10, cex=0.5)

needs to use cex=1 not cex=0.5 for the adjustment.  Perhaps identify is
trying too hard, and should give the user more control over the precise
position of the label (as S-PLUS does).

The same with 

 par(cex=1); plot(1:10); text(4, 5, "Hello World") # OK
 par(cex=2); plot(1:10); text(4, 5, "Hello World") # OK
 par(cex=2); plot(1:10); text(4, 5, "Hello World", cex = 1) # NOT OK
 par(cex=2); plot(1:10); text(4, 5, "Hello World", cex = 0.5)

So the scaling with cex in text() is relative to the par() settings,
which is not the expected behaviour.

It is the documented behaviour, though: see the description of cex in
?help.

     cex: numeric character expansion factor; multiplied by
          `par("cex")' yields the final character size.

Subject: strwidth does not take font into account

One for the wishlist.

The text() function permits the use of different fonts with the arguments
"font" or "vfont".  These create text strings of the same height as the
default font, but of different widths: bold face is slightly wider; vector
fonts are usually much wider.  I think the strwidth() function needs to
take the font into account by also having "font" and "vfont" arguments.
Currently it reports the string width using the default font, which can
be quite different.

Here is a little test function you can use to see how far off the
reported string width is.

test.strwidth <-
function(text, vfont=NULL, cex=NULL, ...)
{
 plot(0,0,xlim=c(-1,1),ylim=c(-1,1), type="n")
 text(0,0, text, adj=c(0,0), offset=0, cex=cex, vfont=vfont, ...)
 abline(h=c(0, strheight(text, cex=cex)), lty=2)
 abline(v=c(0, strwidth(text, cex=cex)), lty=2)
}

e.g.

test.strwidth("This is some text", cex=2)
test.strwidth("This is some text", cex=2, font=2)
test.strwidth("This is some text", vfont=c("sans serif", "plain"))

There seems to be a bug in "dotplot" concerning the "cex" parameter. Setting
cex has no effect on the character size of the labels of the points.
This problem was posted to r-help today (Thu, 18 Jan 2001); the solution
given by Brian Ripley (and Uwe Ligges) seems to work for me.

I notices some indesireable behaviour in interaction.plot. The scaling of
the x-axis labels discards the overall settings for the 'cex' attribute,
leading to unscaled labels. The source for this behaviour is the line

mtext(xlabs, 1, at = xvals)

in interaction.plot.

to get this function to perform conform the manual, change this line to

mtext(xlabs, 1, at = xvals, cex=par("cex"))

and all is well.

because of the simplicity of this 'fix' I assume that it is a crossplatform
thingie, but for the record:

I use R-Win in winNT, 1.2.0, upgrading soon.

just my .02 euro..

I'll just end this mail with a standard declaration of love for R

Hi.  Let's try to explain the subject line with some code:

> split.screen (c(2,1))
[1] 1 2
> screen(1)
> plot (1:2, 1:2, log="y", main="1")
> screen (2)
> plot (1:2, 1:2, main="2")
> screen (1)
Error in par(.split.screens[[n]]) : invalid value specified for graphics parameter "yaxp".
> close.screen(all=TRUE)

Let's add comments:

> split.screen (c(2,1))
[1] 1 2

OK, plot in the top half screen:
> screen(1)
> plot (1:2, 1:2, log="y", main="1")
> par("yaxp")
[1]  1  2 -5

OK, switch to bottom half:
> screen (2)
> plot (1:2, 1:2, main="2")
> par("yaxp")
[1] 1 2 5

OK, looks fine, let's go back up:
> screen (1)
Error in par(.split.screens[[n]]) : invalid value specified for graphics parameter "yaxp".

Bummer.
> close.screen(all=TRUE)

Somehow I'm hoping you'll tell me I'm doing something wrong, because
I'd really would like to be able to do the following:
  repeat {
    #calculate
    screen(1)
    #fancy plot
    screen (2)
    #even fancier plot ;-)
    if (user.bored()) break
  }
Which is roughly what I was doing when the error messages started
popping up.

Thanks,

[I have abbreviated the subject as jitterbug has been having probems
with long subjects.]

The issue here is that one cannot mix log/non-log axes in the calls to
screen(), as the appropriate par() parameter is read-only, but the
meaning of yaxp depends on it.  But beyond that you can't set
x/yaxp for log axes.

You should be able to do this: you can in the S original.

A simpler version:

plot (1:2, 1:2, log="y", main="1")
zz <- par("yaxp")
zz
[1]  1  2 -5
par(yaxp=zz)
Error in par(yaxp = zz) : invalid value specified for graphics parameter
"yaxp".

So you can't reset the yaxp parameter to what it is reported as!


Additional bug: the meaning of x/yaxp for log axes is not defined
in help(par).

[snip]

The code in main/par.c ignores the value of xlog (or ylog) when
setting xaxp (or yaxp).  Right now you have in Specify (and Specify2):

... else if (streql(what, "xaxp")) {
	value = coerceVector(value, REALSXP);
	lengthCheck(what, value, 3);
	naRealCheck(REAL(value)[0], what);
	naRealCheck(REAL(value)[1], what);
        posIntCheck((int) (REAL(value)[2]), what);

Shouldn't that be something like:

... else if (streql(what, "xaxp")) {
	value = coerceVector(value, REALSXP);
	lengthCheck(what, value, 3);
	naRealCheck(REAL(value)[0], what);
	naRealCheck(REAL(value)[1], what);
        if (dd->gp.xlog)
            logAxpCheck((int) (REAL(value)[2]), what);
        else
            posIntCheck((int) (REAL(value)[2]), what);

Where logAxpCheck is suitably defined as:

static void logAxpCheck(int x, char *s)
{
    if (x == NA_INTEGER || x == 0 || x > 4)
	par_error(s);
}

since only values < 0 or the values 1, 2, 3 are allowed?


> Additional bug: the meaning of x/yaxp for log axes is not defined
> in help(par).

excerpt from help(par):

    xaxp: A vector of the form `c(x1, x2, n)' giving the coordinates
          of the extreme tick marks and the number of intervals
          between tick-marks.

Could you add:

          The value of n must be positive for linear scale axes.  For
          logarithmic scale axes n must be either negative (then there
          will be (1-n) ticks at a linear distance) or one of 1, 2, or
          3 where n then indicates the number of ticks per decade.

similar for yaxp?  What am I missing?

Hi.  As far as I understand it, there is a list of graphic primitives
stored for a device.  So for example, when I iconify/deiconify an X11
window, the plot will be redrawn.  Now screen (split.screen and
friends) appear not to handle this list properly, the list is reset or
not reset at odd times.  The commands below will show clearly what I
mean.  There are two effects:

  - After splitting the device real estate into two screens, I can
    plot on these screens, alternating between them.  When I then
    touch the window to force a redraw, *all* the plots are redrawn,
    not just the last (and visible) ones.
    [This happens when the X server runs on AIX, R runs on AIX or Sun.]

  - Again, after splitting, plotting on one screen can affect the
    other screen.  I.e. plot(...); plot (...) on the left screen can
    erase the *right* screen.
    [This happens for all platforms I have access to, AIX, Linux, Sun.]

The first effect may be due to a bad interaction with the X server,
but the second effect is surely not desirable, is it?  Am I mis-using
'screen' here?

Giving an adj argument to axis() seems to have no effect.  In Splus, adj = 0 
left-justifies the labels under the ticks, adj = 1 right justifies them, and

Subject: legend() with xpd=T; omission of initial plot character
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed


In the following:

plot(0:1, 0:1)
legend(x=0, y=1.2, pch=c(1,2), legend=c("May","June"))

the first plot character is omitted when plotting to
the screen.

I obtained the same behaviour when placing a legend
in the margin following use of pairs()

Hi

Bug summary:----
par(xpd=T)
plot(0:1, 0:1)
legend(x=0, y=1.2, pch=c(1,2), legend=c("May","June"))

the first plot character is omitted when plotting to
the screen.
Bug summary:----

I cannot reproduce this bug, BUT it did show up a bug in rect() -- in the
example above, the border around the legend is not drawn.

This is because rect() ignores par(xpd).  The default is rect(xpd=FALSE).  This
is at odds with text(xpd=NULL) and polygon(xpd=NULL) which use par(xpd) by
default.  arrows(xpd=FALSE) has the same problem as rect().  

I propose modifying rect() and arrows() to use par(xpd) by default like text()
and polygon().  There will, as usual, be a small risk that someone's code will
produce different output after this change, but this risk should be pretty
small.

Any objections ... ?

Coincidence, I *did* look at that bug only yesterday.
My experience:
   I *could* reproduce the bug {X11(), Linux-386}, but only a few times. 
   Then, it didn't show anymore. Even restarting R wouldn't show it again.
   My ``explanation'' was that it might be (a bug) inside X11 / Window manager
   handling of things... ??

not at all, but please fix  abline(*) at the same time.
It doesn't obey xpd either (PR#750).

Both of these changes made now (for 1.3.1).  
The following code should demonstrate the bugs (in pre-1.3.1 R) and the fixes:

par(mfrow=c(2,1), xpd=FALSE)
plot(1:10)
plot(1:10)
# rect() and arrow() ignored par(xpd=)
rect(1, 9, 2, 20, col="red")
arrows(1.5, 20, 1.5, 10)
par(xpd=TRUE)
rect(3, 9, 4, 20, col="blue")
arrows(3.5, 20, 3.5, 10)
par(xpd=NA)
rect(5, 9, 6, 20, col="green")
arrows(5.5, 20, 5.5, 10)

This is related to bug #865, which I have discovered is a problem with some
of the very basic transformation code in R graphics (for transforming widths
or heights when there are log scales).  I have a fix for this particular
mtext() problem, but I'm still working on the more general transformation
bug.

This is now fixed (which also fixes PR#865).
Also fixed for mtext() when side=1, log="x", and las=2 (and for corresponding
siutations on sides 3 and 4).
Also fixed for mtext() when text is an expression (i.e., mathematical
annotation).

Unfortunately, the problem goes pretty deep -- it is to do with transformation
of widths and heights to or from USER coordinates when the axis is logged. 
There are a couple of other places where this causes a problem:
(i) strwidth() and strheight() 
(ii) symbols()

I'm leaving this bug active until these other issues are resolved.

Try this

example(palette)

then trigger a redraw e.g. by resizing the window. Shouldn't the
palette be stored as part of the display list?

(This only happens because the palette was reset at the end of the
example, but still...)

I could argue either way on this.

I agree that its nasty to have plot colours change in mid-stream,
but I suspect that adding the palette to the display list may not
be the "right" solution.

A different approach would be to map the colour indices (and names)
to RGB values at a slightly higher level.  That way it would be the
RGB values which would be captured in the display list, not the
indices.

[ I'm afraid that I think that the whole display list mechanism is
  "wrong".  We need a much higher level way of describing plots. ]

I reported this earlier, and have got reports that others have the same
promlem on UNIX machines, so it is not only a windows problem
S I file a bug report.

The function (boot.stat) given at the end produces a postscript file, 
which cannot be included correctly in LaTeX. Specifically, 
the image in LaTeX (when translated by dvips to postscript)
becomes very small, not using the bounding box, and turned on its head!

Apropops todays automatic bug report: The bug #1147 I reported
(postscript, problems with screen layout) which I treported some time
ago, does not anymore occur R1.4.0, windows 98, when I test with the
same code that caused the original problem. Fixed as a by-product of the
internal changes to graphics code?

Subject: x-axis label in persp()


If the surface to be plotted by persp() is supplied as
a list, the x-axis label defaults to the name, in the call,
of this list --- which is usually silly.

I would suggest changing the first four lines of
persp.default() (where the x-axis label gets set) from

if (is.null(xlab))
        xlab <- if (!missing(x))
            deparse(substitute(x))
        else "X"

to

if (is.null(xlab))
        xlab <- if (!missing(x) && !is.list(x) && !is.matrix(x))
            deparse(substitute(x))
        else "X"

which makes the x-axis label default to "X" if the surface
is specified as a list.

Um.  That's plot.formula, not boxplot.  horizontal = TRUE is *not* a
documented argument to plot.formula.  If you pass arguments to boxplot
through ... (rather than just par values), you may well get unexpected
results.

To fix this needs plot.formula to recognize horizontal, and that's
an API change which I don't advocate during feature freeze.
Generally, not doing something which is not documented to happen is not a
bug, so I'll put this on the wishlist.

Yes, it's intentional.  You can always use title().

Submission from: (NULL) (129.132.139.109)


There seems to be a problem with the labelling of axes when
logarithmic scales are used. More than half of 
both axes are not labeled in the following example:


x <-  c(0.12,  0.3,   0.53,  1.1,   1.8,  2.6, 4.5)
y <-  c(0.012, 0.021, 0.032, 0.055, 0.1,  0.2, 0.35)

plot(x, y,
     log="xy",
     main="Problem with axes labelling on logarithmic scales",
     xlab="x, why aren't 0.5, or even smaller tic-values displyed?",
     ylab="y, why isn't 0.05 diplayed?")

Probably only if the functions are making use of par("pin") (and friends
?) as piechart() does:

layout(matrix(c(1,1,2, 1,1,3, 1,1,4), ncol=3, byrow=TRUE))
par("pin")
plot(1); par("pin")  # Here it goes wrong for the next plot.
plot(1); par("pin")
plot(1); par("pin")
plot(1)

And let me add, it is everytime the second one:

layout(matrix(c(1,3, 1,4, 2,5), ncol=2, byrow=TRUE))
for(i in 1:5) piechart( 1:3 )

layout(matrix(c(1,2, 1,4, 3,5), ncol=2, byrow=TRUE))
for(i in 1:5) piechart( 1:3 )

layout(matrix(c(1,3, 1,2, 4,5), ncol=2, byrow=TRUE))
for(i in 1:5) piechart( 1:3 )

From the example of ?interaction.plot:

 data(ToothGrowth)
 attach(ToothGrowth)
 interaction.plot(dose, supp, len, fixed=TRUE) # OK

But the following looks quite ugly:

 par(mfrow=c(1,2))
 interaction.plot(dose, supp, len, fixed=TRUE)
 interaction.plot(dose, supp, len, fixed=TRUE)

 par(mfrow=c(2,2))
 interaction.plot(dose, supp, len, fixed=TRUE)



There is not only a problem with the legend, also the magnification of
the axis annotation is not homogeneous, because for the x-axis
annotation mtext() is used. I'd suggest to change line 35:
  mtext(xlabs, 1, at = xvals) # old
to
  axis(1, at = xvals, labels = xlabs, ...) # new

Full_Name: Murray H Smith

OS: Windows 2000
Submission from: (NULL) (202.36.29.1)


The mgp parameter in par() does not allow negative values. That is, it does not
allow plots with axes ticks and labels inside the plot. The help document,
Introduction to R, under Graphics: Axes and tick marks, specifically mentions
negative values for mgp as a way to achieve internal ticks and labels. 

Code:
> par(mgp=c(-3,-1,0))
Error in par(mgp = c(-3, -1, 0)) : invalid value specified for graphics
parameter "mgp"

> par(mgp=c(3,-1,0))
Error in par(mgp = c(3, -1, 0)) : invalid value specified for graphics parameter
"mgp".

> par(mgp=c(3,1,-1))
Error in par(mgp = c(3, 1, -1)) : invalid value specified for graphics parameter

I can't seem to get axis tick marks in any color except black (I want to make
plots for a slide presentation using a dark background.)  Below is a simple
example.  I have tried this using postscript in the Windows version of R 1.4.1
and a version of R 1.4.0 compiled on a Sun-Solaris system.  Also, the same
problem occurs in the win.metafile driver.

u1 <- runif(10)
u2 <- runif(10)
postscript(file='f:/ecog/statpres/webreg/plot3.ps',pointsize=18)
par(font=2,font.axis=2,font.lab=2,lwd=2.5,bg='midnightblue',col='white',
    col.axis='white',col.main='white',col.lab='white',col.sub='white')
palette(c('white','red','yellow','green','cyan','orange'))
plot(u1,u2,type='n',xlab="Time",ylab='Proportion',main='',
     col='white',col.axis='white') 
points(u1,u2,col=3)
dev.off()

You're looking for the fg parameter. 

(It does say so in help(par), I don't think there's a bug.)

Hello,

I am working with the persp command. I want to change to color of the facets
according
to their z-value. The colors seems to be transposed, i.e. the color of a facet A
seems
to be used for a facet B which is a (defined?) way off....

An example:

nx <- 21 
ny <- 21 
x <- seq(-1, 1, length = nx) 
y <- seq(-1, 1, length = ny)
z <- outer(x, y, function(x,y) x^2 + y^2) 
hgt <- z / max(z) 
persp(x, y, z, col = gray(1 - hgt), theta = 70, phi = 40, expand = 0.4)

Now the z-value should define the color, but the color pattern seems to be
moved.

Thanks,
    Oliver Niggemann

I don't think this is a bug -- I think the problem is that the surface
produced for the z of dimension 21x21 has only 20x20 facets.  For example,
the following is not a solution, but it shows that a 20x20 colour matrix
produces the expected result ...

    persp(x, y, z, col = gray(hgt[1:20,1:20]), theta = 0, phi = 40, expand =
0.4)

... now, what you really want I guess is to calculate hgt to be some
interpolation of the four z values at the four corners of each face.  I am
due somewhere so this calculation is left as an exercise ...

I want to use R to plot an histogram of a vector of size 759 with min=-63260e+06

and max=3.700646.

When I use X11 as the output device, there is no problem to obtain the desired 
graphics using the following instructions:

hist(VED,br=60,prob=TRUE)
lines(density(VED,bw=7.668e+05))

Now, if I use the pictex driver :
pictex(file = "test.pictex")

The whole pictex code is not generated. It stops after line 760.
When I put debug = TRUE, it stops after 243 lines.

Another one, using the same data as in my previous report (PR1651, available 
as http://rjvbertin.free.fr/PR1651data.tab):

kk<-read.table(<data>)
attach(kk)
Snr<-factor(Snr)
# Now try to make a coplot using boxplots:
coplot(nFD~Modality|Type+size, panel = function(x, y, ...) plot(x, y))
# or
coplot(nFD~Modality|Type+size, panel = function(x, y, ...) boxplot(y~x))

This almost functions,only the boxplot matrix is shifted and right-aligned 
with the vertical (size) factor display (seems to be drawn underneath it).
This happens both with the Windows binaries and the source distribution 
compiled under Linux.

I expect only 4 intervals on the x-axis, but find 5 intervals.  The same
problem seems to exist for axis() with a yaxp argument.

The sequence:

> plot(c(0,1),c(0.2,0.3),xaxt="n")
> par(xaxp=c(0,1,4))
> axis(1)

does draw an axis with four intervals, though.

For the record, the place in the C code is in plot.c in do_axis where
there appear to be two problems:  (i)  the code sets a local variable
from the dpptr(dd)->xaxp rather than the gpptr(dd)->xaxp, and (ii) the
code sets this local variable BEFORE calling ProcessInlinePars().  So
there are two obstacles to fix before do_axis will respond to an in-line
xaxp setting.  NOTE also that several other local variables are set from
dpptr(dd)-><something> in the same place, so these should be fixed as
well.

Subject:  mtext() alignment of perpendicular text 


mtext() does a poor job of placing text when it is perpendicular (e.g.,
side=1, las=3) and the font size is not the default.

The following code snippet demonstrates the problem ...

plot(1:10)
abline(v=1:10, col="grey")
axis(3, at=1:10, las=3, labels=FALSE)
mtext(1:10, at=1:10, side=3, line=1, las=3)
axis(3, line=-2, at=1:10, las=3, labels=FALSE)
mtext(1:10, at=1:10, side=3, line=-1, las=3, cex=.5)
axis(3, line=-5, at=1:10, las=3, labels=FALSE)
mtext(1:10, at=1:10, side=3, line=-4, las=3, cex=2)

The ugliness varies a bit across devices.

In GMtext() in graphics.c there is a hardcoded adjustment of 0.3 which
is described as "purely visual tuning".  I think this needs to be
replaced with a more general solution.

Hi,

As a user it is not obvious to me why
"close.screen" should return a warning message in 

split.screen(figs=c(1,2))
i <- 2  
screen(i)
close.screen(i)

whereas no warning message appears for i <- 1.


In fact, the warning message appears since the condition
   .split.valid.screens >  temp
in close.screen is not satisfied by any element of .split.valid.screens

Replacing 

   if (temp %in% n) 
       temp <- min(.split.valid.screens[.split.valid.screens > 
           temp])
   if (temp > max(.split.valid.screens)) 
       temp <- min(.split.valid.screens)

by

   if (temp > max(.split.valid.screens)) 
      temp <- min(.split.valid.screens)
   else
      if (temp %in% n) 
         temp <- min(.split.valid.screens[.split.valid.screens > 
             temp])

should avoid the warning message without any other changings in the
functionality of close.screen.

Cheers,
Martin

Here is an example:

 The legends (mainly the factor level names) are cut off on the
 right.  Somehow the internal calculation which computes
 horizontal space for the legend is not flexible enough.

## Call a new graphics window {with default par()s !}:
get(getOption("device"))()
par(mfrow = c(2,2))

## part of  example(interaction.plot)  _improved_ using with() :
data(OrchardSprays)

    interaction.plot(treatment, rowpos, decrease)
    interaction.plot(rowpos, treatment, decrease)
})

data(esoph)
with(esoph, {

    interaction.plot(agegp, tobgp, ncases/ncontrols, trace.label="tobacco",
                     fixed=TRUE)
})

-------------------------------

Something that should be easy to fix, but needs some care (and
time).

Martin, 

not right now (may be easy, but obviously not very easy ;-)). 
I'd like to comment that I filed this already as bug report #1305,
including a suggestion for a fix for a second bug related to axis
annotation.

Best,
Uwe

Hello R experts!

I've tried to make single plot, but with changed ticks length,
and then copy them to file by dev.copy2eps(). Here is the code:

   x11 ( , 5, 5)
   par (tcl = +5) 
   plot (0)        # that's ugly plot with great ticks
                   # on the graph viewport.  cool :)
   dev.copy2eps (file = "out.eps")

Hm.. I had a look at "out.ps" and wondered that ticks
look like as they would being set to there *default* value,
"tcl" = -0.5!  =-O

Ok, I tried then to make same thing by slightly different way:

    postscript (file = "out1.eps", onefile = FALSE)
    par (tcl = +5)
    plot (0)
    dev.off ()

Beautiful -- all the ticks have an appropriate length, tcl == +5!

Why?

This looks like a problem with package dependencies.  Should be sending this to
the 
package author, not r-bugs?


An attempt to install lattice from the windows binary runs OK, but attempting to
load the library an error occurs:

> install.packages("D:/Software/R/lattice.zip", .lib.loc[1], CRAN = NULL)
updating HTML package descriptions
> library(lattice)
Error in parse(file, n, text, prompt) : syntax error on line 2022

I then tried installing under linux with R 1.5.1

This installed OK, but loading the library gave another error:

> library(lattice)
Error in library(grid) : There is no package called `grid'

Installing grid on linux resulted in lattice loading and working properly

Installing grid also fixed the problem on windows.

Full_Name: Johnny Accot
Version: 1.5.1
OS: Linux
Submission from: (NULL) (198.4.83.52)


Hi.

I'm having a problem with the binary read/write functions.  I'm writing a device
driver in R (why not?) and of course I have to send a couple commands to the
device.  Typically, I send one byte, receive one acknowledgement byte, send
another byte, receive an ACK, and so on.  At least this is what I would like to
do.  Instead, after writing one byte, reading its acknowledgement byte, and
writing a second byte, R hangs on the next read for an unknown reason.  I guess
this is a bug in the read/write functions.  If you have a PS/2 device you may
try to run the following code:

ascii <- sapply(1:255, function(i)
parse(text=paste("\"\\",structure(i,class="octmode"),"\"",sep=""))[[1]])
dev <- file("/dev/psaux")
open(dev, "w+b")
writeChar(ascii[246], dev, eos=NULL)
readBin(dev, what=integer(), n=1, size=1, signed=FALSE)
writeChar(ascii[246], dev, eos=NULL)
readBin(dev, what=integer(), n=1, size=1, signed=FALSE)
close(dev)

which gives:

> ascii <- sapply(1:255, function(i)
parse(text=paste("\"\\",structure(i,class="octmode"),"\"",sep=""))[[1]])
> dev <- file("/dev/psaux")
> open(dev, "w+b")
> writeChar(ascii[246], dev, eos=NULL)
> readBin(dev, what=integer(), n=1, size=1, signed=FALSE)
[1] 250
> writeChar(ascii[246], dev, eos=NULL)
> readBin(dev, what=integer(), n=1, size=1, signed=FALSE)
[...R hangs here...]

It first creates an ascii table, opens the PS/2 device for binary read&write,
writes the byte 0xF6 (246 in decimal, which means: set default; it is harmless),
reads the acknowledgement byte 0xFA (250 in decimal), writes another 0xF6, and
then hangs when reading the second acknowledgement byte.  If, instead, you close
the device between the two writes, it's fine:

> ascii <- sapply(1:255, function(i)
parse(text=paste("\"\\",structure(i,class="octmode"),"\"",sep=""))[[1]])
> 
> dev <- file("/dev/psaux", "w+b")
> writeChar(ascii[246], dev, eos=NULL)
> readBin(dev, what=integer(), n=1, size=1, signed=FALSE)
[1] 250
> close(dev)
> 
> dev <- file("/dev/psaux", "w+b")
> writeChar(ascii[246], dev, eos=NULL)
> readBin(dev, what=integer(), n=1, size=1, signed=FALSE)
[1] 250
> close(dev)

This is not a feature, is it? :-)  The behavior is the same in versions 1.4.1,
1.5.0 and 1.5.1 on my computer.  I don't have to send bytes very often, so I'll
stick with the open-each-time strategy, but it is not very clean.

I also tried to write bytes using the writeBin command, but it says the "size=1"
is not available on my computer.  This is why I'm using the writeChar function.

Please let me know if I'm doing something wrong.  I hope not.

And thanks for the great software! :-)

Johnny

PS: if you try to run the code and don't get 250 as acknowledgement byte, it
means the PS/2 controller is not in idle state.  Very unlikely though.  Try
again as the set-default command should bring it back to its idle state.

Not a bug: check the documentation of file(), which is documented to work
for files but not for devices.  No attempt is made to cope with e.g.
blocking on non-files.

It's a pretty extreme view of the world to consider /dev/psaux to be a
file, and R is just using standard C <stdio.h> I/O.

However, this is a great opportunity for you to contribute a device()
function to R.

I finally checked the code and "wrote" the functions to "handle devices".
Well, in fact I more or less duplicated the code for FIFOs, removed the
option for encoding, added an option for synchronous I/O, and added a
test to check that the file is indeed a character or block special file.
This works great for me but I'm afraid it is a bit simple and does not
cover much of device handling in general.  Especially I don't know if
anybody would want to use it for block devices, and what they would need.
The psaux device is one of the simplest device one could think of, that's
why it works so well.  For other devices one would need at least an
ioctl function, which I didn't write.  But still I have no idea whether
anybody would use it and what for.  Anyway.  Please let me know if you
think this is useful.  If yes, I will try to familiarize myself with
the structure of the R code and make the device handling more general.

Thanks,
Johnny

Yes, I do think it would be useful, but I know little about it,

Sometimes, configure isn't able to create the makefiles. It
produces errors like:

sed: Function s%@PDFLATEX@%/usr/local/bin/pdflatex%g cannot be parsed.

This happens when I use a combination of arguments to configure like:

    --prefix=$HOME/R-tst
    --with-tcl-config=/opt_local/opt/tcl/lib/tclConfig.sh
    --with-tk-config=/opt_local/opt/tk/lib/tkConfig.sh

If I leave out the last two arguments, the problem does not
occur.

If I change the first argument to --prefix=$HOME/Rtst, the
problem does not occur.

You sent this twice, for some reason.

It's hard to tell what `the standard GNU gcc package (from the Sun site)'
actually is.  However, R 1.3.1 did compile under Solaris 2.6 with gcc
2.95.3 compiled under Solaris 2.6.  The error appears to be a mismatch
between your compiler and your assembler.  I don't think that qualifies as
a bug in R, and definitely is one we can do nothing about.  lbfgsb.c does
seem to be valid C that is accepted by a wide range of compilers on
Solaris and elsewhere.

Assuming that the "Sun site" means www.sunfreeware.com, I seem to
recall that you get in trouble if you use gcc3 without GNU binutils.

As you mentioned below, R 1.3.1 does compile on Solaris with gcc 2.95.  I've tried 
both Solaris 2.5.1 and Solaris 2.6 with this, and they are fine.  Moving to gcc 
3.03 however causes the problem.  

Thanks for you help earlier.

-Joe.

We need to know your compiler system. This is I seem to remember a symptom
of using gcc made on SunOS 5.5 under 5.6/7, so if this is gcc, was it
built under 5.7?

BTW, R is now at 1.4.1, not 1.3.0.

When running make for R-1.4.1 on Solaris 8, SPARC 64 bit the following error

You haven't told us anything about your compilers.  You can set options to
make ints 64bits, and you must not for use with R.

This works correctly for me, using SunPro 6 compilers.

The configure script reports the size of ints, and if this is not 4 bytes,
change the options.  If it is 4 bytes, the correct option will be set.

Almost certainly your c++ is g++ installed in /usr/local, and
you don't have /usr/local/lib in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

In short
> checking whether the C++ compiler (c++  ) works... no

is correct, and that's not a problem with R but with your system.
First get a simple C++ program working.

If this is a current gcc (3.0.x), the same problem will occur with gcc
eventually in the build process (for libgcc.so).

The configure script failed on tk on several platforms. One is
given below. This did not happen on versions of R older than 1.5.0.

Message from configure:

configure: WARNING: /opt_local/opt/tk-8.0/include/tk.h: accepted by the compiler, rejected by the preprocessor!
configure: WARNING: /opt_local/opt/tk-8.0/include/tk.h: proceeding with the preprocessor's result

This was in config.log, the command on a single line:

I had to edit tkConfig.sh to solve this problem. This line:

TK_XINCLUDES='# no special path needed'

changed to this:

TK_XINCLUDES=


After this fix, R was configured for tcl/tk, and the package
tcltk seems to work OK (at least on this platform).

First, this is not a bug in R, so please don't use the BUGS database for
errors on your own system.

The message actually means that fort77 is not working properly: some
library is missing.

Please install g77 and try again.  On RH7.2 it is in rpm  gcc-g77-2.96-98.

I compiled R-1.5.0 on SuSE 7.2. Everything worked out, including
make check.  However, the escape sequences generated by the arrow
keys are not correctly understood.  So, I cannot e.g. get the previous
command by up arrow.  I had the same problem, when compiled R-1.4.1
on SuSE 7.2.

The problem was not present in precompiled binary R-1.3.0.rpm for
SuSE 7.2 from CRAN, however, I need at least R-1.4.1 for randomForest.

Compiling R-1.4.1 on RedHat based system was also OK, but I have SuSE
as my basic system.

I compared the output of "strace R" for the precompiled R-1.3.0 and
R-1.5.0 compiled by myself:

The correct behaviour of R-1.3.0 may be due to the fact, that
it reads /usr/share/terminfo/x/xterm
(in strace output: open("/usr/share/terminfo/x/xterm", O_RDONLY) = 4),
while the R-1.5.0 does not read it
(no occurrence of "xterm" in strace output).

I think, it should be something simple, but I do not know how
to force R to read the terminfo file. I appreciate any help from you.

Kind regards

I include more information to my message sent
at Tue, 11 Jun 2002 19:51:24 +0200 with the same

I have the readline package properly installed:

The usual suspect is the readline-devel package.

I am trying to get RT-1.5.0 installed on Solaris 8.

The programs compile fine and 'make check' seems to work.

But when I do a 'make install' I see this:

/home/dhouston/R-1.5.0 grieg> make install
installing afm ...
installing doc ...
installing doc/html ...
install:  index.html does not exist
*** Error code 1

*** Error code 1
make: Fatal error: Command failed for target `install'
Current working directory /home/dhouston/R-1.5.0/doc
*** Error code 1
make: Fatal error: Command failed for target `install'

I do not see index.html in doc/html. I made a fake one for testing purposes, but
when I do a make install it now fails trying to find SearchEngine.html.

I did a 'make html' but to no avail.

Those should have been generated during the build, by the Makefile's in
doc/html and doc/html/search.

Do you perchance not have Perl installed?

Hi,

I was looking at configure.in for R-1.4.1 and in the
  case "${host_cpu}" in
part under alpha CPU's, the switch of -mieee for g77 and -fpe3 otherwise
is an OSF specific, not alpha specific issue.  In particular, if someone
used f2c-f77 (shell script which emulates a fortran compiler with f2c and
the c compiler), they'd get the broken -fpe3.  I'd probably either test
for OSF before adding -fpe3

Hi,

Thanks for developing an outstanding software for free. I admire all your 
effort greatly. I would like to submit a bug report on the R-1.5.1 
installer (in .mpkg, .pkg format) for Mac OS X.

I'm using fink in conjunction with Darwin. In my environment, /usr/local is 
symbolically linked to /sw which is fink's main directory. This is to 
conform the directory structure on my machine to the standard UNIX/Linux 
one.

It turned out that R-1.5.1 installer ignores the symbolic link and creates 
new /usr/local/bin and /usr/local/lib directories on their own, thereby 
installing all its stuff into them. This is really annoying. (Actually, 
after installing R, bash stopped running. At first, I couldn't figure out 
at all what happened. It turned out that bash failed to runs because it 
lost access dynamic libraries in /usr/local/lib directory.)

I hope the installer properly follows symbolic links during installation.

Cheers,
Kow

Dear sir,

This is siva Ginjupalli.

I am getting following error while configuring my Solaris for "R" software.

checking size of int... configure: error: cannot compute sizeof (int), 77.

My solaris information as follows:

uname -m = sun4u
uname -r = 5.8
uname -s = SunOS
uname -v = Generic_108528-01

/usr/bin/uname -p = sparc
/bin/uname -X     = System = SunOS
Release = 5.8
KernelID = Generic_108528-01
Machine = sun4u
BusType = <unknown>
Serial = <unknown>
Users = <unknown>
OEM# = 0
Origin# = 1
NumCPU = 2

I really appreciate if you could guide me to resolve this problem.

Please let me know, if you need config.log file to debug

Thanks
Siva

Dear all

yesterday I got around to install R-1.5.1 on my machine at home which,
admittedly, is running a very old version of RedHat Linux.  I noticed
two things:

1) My pdflatex version is too old to produce the pdf version of the
   manuals.  `./configure' checks whether a recent version of makeinfo
is installed and tells you whether you can produce the info version or
not.  (I was told I couldn't, another reason to upgrate the machine.)
But during configuration there don't seem to be any check whether the
pdflatex is recent enough.  You might want to consider to add such a
check.

2) `./configure' checks whether Perl 5.004 (or later) is installed.
   On my machine Perl 5.00405 is installed and the installation went
ahead without problems.  However, when I then tried to install
R-1.5.1-recommended by issuing the command
        R CMD INSTALL *.tar.gz
in the appropriate directory, I received complaints about my Perl
version.  Essentially, R wanted all of a sudden Perl 5.005 (or
later).  An edited version of what I saw on my terminal is included
below.  I got the same kind of error message when I used from within R
`update.packages' and `install.packages' to update/install some
packages that are not in R-1.5.1-recommended.
As far as I can tell, the installation of the packages went ahead fine
except that the `TITLE' file for each of these packages is empty.
Hence, I guess the error message is produced when R tries to generate
and install the `TITLE' file.  However, the `TITLE' files for the
packages in the base distribution are fine.  This leaves me wondering
why during the base installation Perl 5.004 (or later) is good enough
for producing the `TITLE' file but for `R CMD INSTALL' Perl 5.005 (or
later) is required.   

Cheers,

        Berwin

Well, we would need to know which version failed.  What is yours?

doc/manuals/README mentions pdftex-0.14d.  *ANY* version older than 1.00
is unreleased and experimental, but versions as old as -0.13d have worked.

That is correct.  Most things require 5.004, a few require 5.005.
Why is that a bug?

The issue is the use of the Text::Wrap module in share/perl/R/Utils.pm,
where 5.004_05 was broken (we discovered).

0.12h it seems.  (See below).  The hyperref package coming with that
installation is also too old, it seems....

Did I claim it was a bug? :) Anyway, from the FAQ:

    If a command you are familiar with causes an R error message in a
    case where its usual definition ought to be reasonable, it is
    probably a bug.

After installing R and knowing that `./configure' checks which Perl
version I have, I expect to have a system that works fine and doesn't
all of a sudden tell me that my Perl version is too old and cannot
perform a `complete' install of addtional packages.  If part of R
needs Perl 5.005, why don't you check for Perl 5.005?  O.k., you can
argue that it wasn't an error message but just a warning, or that I am
not familiar with the command (fair enough too :-) ), but the FAQ
continues:

   If you aren't familiar with the command, or don't know for certain
   how the command is supposed to work, then it might actually be
   working right. Rather than jumping to conclusions, show the problem
   to someone who knows for certain.

And I did exactly the latter, labeling my report `inconsistent use of
Perl'.  Rest assured, if I think something is a bug, then I will say
so in the subject line. :)

Cheers,

        Berwin

Subject: convolution bug

Full_Name: Bill Simpson
Version: 65.1 , 0.90.1
OS: Linux
Submission from: (NULL) (193.62.250.209)


I reported this on r-help, but here is official bug report.

The present convolve() does not do convolution by default. Its default behaviour
is
correlation. This is a bug.

The default argument conj should be set to FALSE.

The zero-padding should be on the right for linear convolution (don't ask me
why you call this type="open"; I suggest type="linear").

Here is what I expect linear convolution to do:
myconvolve<-function (x,h) 
{
    nx <- length(x)
    nh <- length(h)
    #zero pad
    if(nx>nh)
       {
       x <- c(x,rep(0, nh-1))
       h<-c(h,rep(0,nx-1))
       }
    else
       {
       h <- c(h,rep(0, nx-1))
       x<-c(x,rep(0,nh-1))
       }
    x <- fft(fft(x) * fft(h), inv = TRUE)
    Re(x)/length(x)
#I am not sure about this, the R IFFT is weird
}

What "circular" convolution should do is just
eliminate the zero-padding:

myconvolve2<-function (x,h)
{
#no padding, circular convolution
    nx <- length(x)
    nh <- length(h)
    x <- fft(fft(x) * fft(h), inv = TRUE)
    Re(x)/(nx)
}


I suggest that you create two functions, convolve() and correlate(), and get
rid
of the conj argument in convolve().

Call objects don't always behave as you'd expect. They're mostly
list-like, but with exceptions:

> f<-function(x,y,...)match.call(expand.dots=FALSE)
> xx <- f(y=1,2,z=3,4)
> dd <- xx$...
> xx$... <- NULL
> c(xx,dd)
[[1]]
f(x = 2, y = 1)

$z
[1] 3

[[3]]
[1] 4

> as.call(c(as.list(xx),dd))
f(x = 2, y = 1, z = 3, 4)

(Splus has this rather differently, since dd becomes a call to list()
rather than a list of promises:

S> c(xx,dd)
f(x = 2, y = 1, list, z = 3, 4)
S> as.call(c(as.list(xx),dd))
f(x = 2, y = 1, list, z = 3, 4)

...but at least gives the same in both cases)

Also, the names of arguments added with [[<- is getting dropped if a
new element is required:

> xx[["abc"]]<-123
> xx
f(x = 2, y = 1, 123)

S has what I'd expect there:

S> xx[["abc"]]<-123
S> xx
f(x = 2, y = 1, abc = 123)

[R-0.99.0 prerelease on RedHat6.1, but this is likely not a new thing.]

Reply-To: Martin Maechler <maechler@stat.math.ethz.ch>

This is not only bug report, but also a RFC (request for comments):

The basic problem is that there are (at least) two ways of easily getting
non-factor character columns in data.frames.
The first is  
    read.table(*, as.is = TRUE) 
and the second is
    data.frame(.., I(...), ..)	      

which differ in their result. Whereas the first produces `pure' character
columns in the data.frame, the second approach gives `AsIs' classed
columns (character, or, e.g. logical).

Now, as the following shows,  rbind.data.frame()  *is* buggy anyway,
I wonder if we shouldn't change read.table(*, as.is = TRUE)
such that the non-numeric columns of its result become "AsIs" classed as
well:

-----------

str(d1 <- data.frame(a=1:3, b = I(letters[1:3])))
## d1 is `alright'
## d0: The same but a `character' *not* protected by AsIs:
d0 <- d1
d0$b <- unclass(d0$b)
str(d0)
## Note that this is *really* the same as a what you get from
##  read.table(*, as.is = TRUE)
##  ----------
##  R's read.table() is S+ compatible; however I wonder if
##  we shouldn't add  "AsIs" classes to all non-numeric components...
##  the classes, shouldn't harm, but ensure consistency of treatment..

str(d11 <- rbind(d1, new = c(7, "N"))) ## alright
str(d01 <- rbind(d0, new = c(7, "N"))) ## all wrong :
## Both columns were coerced to factors !!
##-- S-PLUS 5 coerces both to "character" -- which is better,
##  since the new row *is* all character

## R makes nonsense with 'b' [factor w/ 1 level "N": NA NA NA 1]
## S+ 5.1 does exactly the right thing [both a & b still look like in d0,d1 :
str(d12 <- rbind(d1, new = data.frame(a= 7, b="N")))##
str(d02 <- rbind(d0, new = data.frame(a= 7, b="N")))##

Under R 1.3.0 on Solaris and Windows NT  there seems to be a bug in == when
applied to elements of a list, particularly when one of the elements is of
mode integer:

	> list(1) == list(1)
	[1] FALSE
	> 1 == list(1)
	[1] TRUE
	> as.integer(1)==list(as.integer(1))
	[1] FALSE
	> as.integer(1)==list(as.double(1))
	[1] FALSE
	> list(as.integer(1))==list(as.integer(1))
	[1] FALSE
	> list(as.integer(1))==as.integer(1)
	[1] FALSE
	> list(as.double(1))==list(as.double(1))
	[1] FALSE

However, these cases work:

	> as.double(1)==list(as.integer(1))
	[1] TRUE
	> list(as.integer(1))==as.double(1)
	[1] TRUE

Replacing the bare integer/double with a vector constructed with c() doesn't
change the results, and comparing between vectors created with c() appears
correct.

It is not entirely clear what we *should* be doing here. S (-PLUS 3.4)
is at least consistent:

> list(1) == list(1)
Error in list(1) == list(1): == operation on mode "list" undefined
Dumped
>  1 == list(1)
Error in 1 == list(1): == operation on mode "list" undefined
Dumped
> as.integer(1)==list(as.integer(1))
Error in as.integer(1) == list(as.integer(1)): == operation on mode "list"
        undefined
Dumped
...

so one might argue that you shouldn't do that in the first place...
(or that the bug is that we do not expressly forbid doing this.)

As of 1.4, we will have the `identical' function, which is the right way
to do such comparisons in any case.

So I'd vote for making a use of the comparison operators an error unless
the type is correct (or there is a method defined).  There is even code
in relop.c (commented out) that looks like the right test.  Any
objections?

Not really, except that I get the usual nagging suspicion that someone
(who?) meant something by doing it this way...

The current logic seems to be that if either side of the == is a
vector of atomic type, try to coerce the list on the other side to a
similar object and then test. However this has a clear bug in that the
coercion is to double even when the atomic vector is integer. If there
are lists on both sides, a pointer comparison is done:

> x<-2
> list(x)==list(x)
[1] FALSE
> list(.Alias(x))==list(.Alias(x))
[1] TRUE

The latter seems highly dubious to me. I'd rather have a recursive
pairwise application of "==" there. However, none of this is what
identical does, is it?

Though tapply(x, factor, fun, simplify =TRUE) should be equivalent to
sapply(split(x, factor), fun, simplify=TRUE), note simplify=TRUE, it is not
so if fun() returns a vector rather than a scalar, e.g.

> tapply(1:6, c(0,0,0,1,1,1), function(x) c(min=min(x), max=max(x)),
simplify=TRUE)
$"0"
min max 
  1   3 

$"1"
min max 
  4   6 

> sapply(split(1:6, c(0,0,0,1,1,1)), function(x) c(min=min(x), max=max(x)),
simplify=TRUE)
    0 1
min 1 4
max 3 6

The patch submitted below fixes this problem
> tapply.new(1:6, c(0,0,0,1,1,1), function(x) c(min=min(x), max=max(x)),
simplify=TRUE)
    0 1
min 1 4
max 3 6

Another potential problem, which I am not able to verify at the moment, is
that whenever simplification is possible S-Plus returns a TRANSPOSE of that
of R, i.e.
  min max
0   1   3
1   4   6

Fixing this would require small changes to both tapply and sapply and I'll
be happy to provide the patches if requested.

S-Plus takes names of the form ".2logl" since it sees a single set of
letters beginning with "." and continuing with alphanumerics.
> .2logl <- function(x) 2*log(x)
> .2logl(3)
[1] 2.197225
>

The same name is rejected by R, my guess is that the ".2" is recognized as
a number and then there is no operator symbol between the "2" and the
following alphabet symbols.
> .2logl <- function(x) 2*log(x)
Error: syntax error

Is this an intentional syntax difference between R and S?  Or is it a bug?

X-ECS-MailScanner: Found to be clean

Hi everyone,

I encountered unexpected behaviour when calling "missing" within a
"local" environment, namely

fred <- function(x, y)
{
  x <- as.vector(x)
  local({
    dontwantme <- 1:100
    if (missing(y)) print("No \"y\" today")
  })
  x
}

whereupon I get

> fred(1:10)
Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos) : "missing" illegal use of missing

I think it is reasonable to expect missing to work in this context (I
suspect the problem relates to lazy evaluation): if not, it might be
helpful to amend the help file.

Cheers, Jonathan.

Why do you think it reasonable?  You've take a function from

     Evaluate an R expression in a specified environment.

and evaluated it somewhere where missing() is not defined.  If you had
used eval() explicitly, would you think it reasonable?  I doubt it.

Which help file did you have in mind?

By "reasonable" in this context I mean that the operation would appear
to be well-defined and useful.  I can access x within the local()
environment, ie it is found in the enclosing environment, and I do not
think that y should be treated any differently.  If I modify my function
to read

fred <- function(x, y)
{
  x <- as.vector(x)
  local({
    print(x)
    print(y)
    if (missing(y)) print("No \"y\" today")
  })
  x
}

then I get the error message

> fred(1:10)
 [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10
Error in print(y) : Argument "y" is missing, with no default

This error message suggests to me that "missing(y)" would evaluate
correctly.

The help file for "missing".  This points out that "missing" is not
always reliable, eg after "x <- match.arg(x)".  Perhaps this could be
another example of "unreliability".

Elements of a dataframe may be a matrix or another dataframe. In
this case the summary() method can do bad things:

> x <- data.frame(1:10)
> x$z <- data.frame(x=1:10,y=1:10)
> summary(x)
     X1.10          z                  
 Min.   : 1.00   NULL:Min.   : 1.00    
 1st Qu.: 3.25   NULL:1st Qu.: 3.25    
 Median : 5.50   NULL:Median : 5.50    
 Mean   : 5.50   NULL:Mean   : 5.50    
 3rd Qu.: 7.75   NULL:3rd Qu.: 7.75    
 Max.   :10.00   NULL:Max.   :10.00    
                 NULL:Min.   : 1.00    
                 NULL:1st Qu.: 3.25    
                 NULL:Median : 5.50    
                 NULL:Mean   : 5.50    
                 NULL:3rd Qu.: 7.75    
                 NULL:Max.   :10.00    

 - this comes from summary(x) calling summary(x$z) and
not handling the fact that summary(x$z) has an element for
each column.

 I think this may be a can of worms. There is a difference
between:

 x <- data.frame(1:10,z=data.frame(1:10,1:10))
and
 x <- data.frame(1:10) ; x$z<-data.frame(1:10,1:10)

 In the first case data.frame() will take columns of the z= argument
and add them to x so that x ends up with 3 elements. In the second
case x ends up with two elements (although it prints as three columns
with identical names for $z).

 Should data frames (and matrices) be allowed as elements of data frames
(assuming they have the right number of rows)? If _not_, then "$<-.data.frame"
should either behave like data.frame(z=...) above or disallow it, and if _so_
then 
summary.data.frame needs tweaking to cope.

 [Splus has similar behaviour, except only for data.frames in data.frames, but
that's because in Splus summary(a matrix) is summary of the whole matrix and 
so only has one element. In R the summary() of a matrix is an element for each
column. Now where's the Splus jitterbug?]

And the bug is?

The generic indexing should really be x[...,drop=T].  Methods for
specific classes can specialize to a particular number of indices if
they want to, which is what is happening here

> get ("[.data.frame")
function (x, i, j, drop = if (missing(i)) TRUE else length(cols) == 
    1) 

one could fairly easily slip in a "..." argument after "j", and then
inside the function give an error if "..." is not empty, but what
would the point be?

The point would be to catch errors like this

for ( i in 1:2 ) foo[i,2] <- my.fun( bar[,i,2] , another.arg )

that might otherwise pass unnoticed when 'bar' is a data.frame.

I'm surprised we don't get more of these sorts of things on UNIX.  Our
current UNIX interrupt handling approach takes an immediate LONGJMP
out of the signal handler no matter where the signal occurs (except
for two places where signals are suspended).  Any place where an
invariant is temporarily broken, any place where an assignment is not
yet complete, is a potential trouble spot.

I've been meaning to raise this issue at some point: I think we will
need to eventually spend some time re-examining how we want to handle
interrupts.  Right now on Windows/Mac interrupts are only processed at
special points in the evaluation process, which is a bit restrictive
(but perhaps unavoidable due to OS limitations).  On UNIX on the other
hand we LONGJUMP out of the signal handler except for the very few
places where the signal gets masked temporarily (GC and one place in
graphics I believe).  The UNIX approach is much too loose even now,
and it becomes even more untenable if we add any kind of threading
support.

We will I think have to come up with a cleaner model for very
selectively enabling interrupt processing, perhaps with some
integration with the external function registration mechanism Duncan
added recently (e.g. marking a function as one where LONGJMP's are
safe).  We will also need some means of controlling interrupt
behaviour from R, such as having some sort of without.interrupts and
with.interrupts functions to be able to program reliable interaction
with interrupts at the R level. (Another sort of thing we might
consider is suspending interrupts during on.exit processing.)

It's a farily big can of worms, and probably not urgent for now, but
we will need to look at it eventually.

FWIW, Octave doesn't do this correctly either, it just does a longjmp,
same as R, which can result in leaking memory, and possibly other bad
things.

The way Bash handles this is to only set a flag in the handler for
SIGINT, then at safe places in the code, there are

  QUIT;

statements.  These are macros that expand to some code that may
longjump somewhere depending on the interrupt state.  This method
avoids the problems of jumping out of the signal handler, which may
result in memory leaks or inconsistencies in global state.  The hard
part is inserting the (many!) QUIT statements, though it is probably
somewhat easier if this type of choice is made early on in the life of
the program instead of late.

I only mention Bash because it is a program that is expected to
handle a lot of interrupts without leaking memory or crashing, and
seems to do so reasonably well.

Packages like R and Octave also have to be able to handle interrupts
in calls Fortran or C code that may run for a long time, and which
cannot be modified (at least not easily) to add the equivalent QUIT
calls.  I'm not sure what the right solution is for cases like that.

With an existing workspace the same happens with R-1.4.0 (unstable) on
WinNT4.

Also in R-1.4.0 (unstable) the last lines of your example, if started
without an existing workspace, results in:

>  print.a(tmp)
[1] "this is a"
[1] 1 2 3
Levels:  1 2 3 
>  get("print.a")(tmp)
[1] "this is a"
Error in get("print.a")(tmp) : function is not a closure
>  get("print.a")
Error: attempt to apply non-function

#### Now a crash!

This comes from this spot:

(gdb) 
#3  0x080cc4cc in do_nextmethod (call=0x873cc68, op=0x8214ee8,args=0x873cd2c, 
    env=0x8b2f394) at ../../../R/src/main/objects.c:488
488         s = findFun(CAR(cptr->call), cptr->sysparent);

CAR(cptr->call) grabs the first element of the call. In a construction
like get("print.a")(tmp) that will be  get("print.a"). However, findFun
assumes that it is being passed a symbol, and pokes a HASHVALUE into
what it thinks is the PRINTNAME of the object, and all hell breaks
loose. 

However, given the way that method dispatch works (by "dotting on" the
class name to the function name), I don't think this kind of
construction makes sense at all.  

There probably needs to be a check in findFun that its symbol argument
really is one. It is however of the "Doctor, it hurts when I do this"
variety, and it might be better to keep our hands off it this close to
release time.

Peter, your explanation looks right to me, and is certainly consistent
with the crash behavior of
get("print.a")
The R-1.4.0 error message is a good check.

I would think the explanation should prevent the other example from
working as well.  But this one works
get("print.factor")(tmp)
exactly as expected.

Both of these examples work correctly in S-Plus 4.5

(S-PLUS 3.4 too)

There's no NextMethod in print.factor, but I was wrong on the other
example: It has NextMethod("print",....) with an explicit generic, so
I don't think it should go near the CAR(call) bit at all.

I'll take a closer look, but there's also a few other nasty bugs
nagging us at the moment, and this looks like it could require surgery
to do_nextmethod with some risk of complications.

I don't think I'll get to look at this cerefully today, but here is
just a thought: My recollection is that NextMethod needs to be called
only from within a usemethod dispatch because the dispatch needs to
set up stuff in the environment that NextMethod needs.  If you do

print.a <- function(...) NextMethod()

and then call print.a directly then the stuff NextMethod needs isn't
set up, so NextMethod can't do anything useful.  I think the
do_nextmethod tries to detect this and raise an error, but for some
reason it isn't detecting the problem here.

I tried the same exercise in S-Plus 6.  S-Plus 6 rejects any direct use
of a method.  It requires use of the generic.  It provides an error message
that might make sense to us, but probably not to a user.  The message
is consistent with Luke's intuition of coming into the middle of a sequence
that was not properly initiated with UseMethod.

Hi guys,

I am planning to let my students do some simulations regarding the
bias of the sample standard deviation.  The following function is
pretty standard (so I hope :) ):

> sim <- function(nrng, replic, true.s, random, ...){
+   res <- NULL
+   for(n in nrng){
+     data <- matrix(random(n*replic,...), ncol=replic)
+     val <- sqrt(apply(data, 2, var))
+     res <- rbind(res,
+                  cbind(bias=val-true.s, n=n))
+   }
+   res
+ }

It takes a vector of sample sizes, a number (the number of
replications we want to simulate), the true value of the standard
deviation and a function that generates the random number (which may
depend on additional paramters).  So let's try this:

> nrng <- c(2,4,8,16,32,64)
> replic <- 500
> true.s <- 2
> tmp <- sim(nrng, replic, true.s, rnorm, sd = 2)

Yes, seems to work.  Now I thought of perhaps creating a list of
several scenarios (random numbers) and loop over it.  So I tried:

> dist <- list(list(rnorm, true.s = 2, sd=2),
+              list(rexp, true.s = 1)
+              )

Followed by

> res <- sim(nrng, replic, dist[[1]][2], dist[[1]][1], dist[[1]][-c(1,2)])
Error in as.vector(data) : couldn't find function "random"

O.k., this doesn't work.  So let us try:

> res <- sim(nrng, replic, dist[[1]][2], as.function(dist[[1]][1]), dist[[1]][-c(1,2)])
Error in as.function.default(dist[[1]][1]) : 
        invalid body argument for "function"
Should NEVER happen; please bug.report() [mkCLOSXP]

No idea why you consider this a bug. :)  I would have been willing to
put it down to my misuse of R.  But since you requested a bug report,
here it is.

Cheers,

        Berwin

BTW:  How can I actually do what I want to do?  I realise that I am
probably on a completely wrong track regarding the passing of the
... parameters.

The problem appears to be with as.POSIXct on the Mac.  Operations that
don't coerce to POSIXct work, those that do, don't.

I think I've found why.

The epoch date on the Mac is 1904-1-1 not 1970-1-1.

This has two effects. First, everything's off by 66 years. Second, it's
important to treat the time as unsigned long, not long, since it's already
greater than 2^31 some time in 1997.

Aren't standards wonderful?

On http://r-bugs.biostat.ku.dk/cgi-bin/R pressing "new bug report" returns a new
form. It would, IMHO, be natural to place the "submit bug report" button on this
form *below* the input area for the actual bug report :-)

With some editors on Unix bug.report() does this. The problem is that
some editors (like Nedit) fork a separate process and return. The Unix
version of bug.report sends an empty message in this case. The fix is to
make the Unix version the same as the Windows version, with an optional
argument "wait".

Attached are four small files bug.report.R, bug.report.Rd, Sys.mail.R,
and Sys.mail.Rd, which attempt to fix the problem and the documentation.
They also separate out the mail mechanism as a utility that can be used
elsewhere. Unfortunately, I have only been able to test these on a
limited number of platforms.

\details{
  Currently direct submission of bug reports works only on Unix systems.
  If the submission method is \code{"mailx"}, then the default editor is
  used to write the bug report. Which editor is used can be controlled
  using \code{\link{options}}, type \code{getOption("editor")} to see what
  editor is currently defined. Please use the help pages of the
  respective editor for details of usage. After saving the bug report
  (in the temporary file opened) and exiting the editor
  the report is mailed using a Unix command line mail utility such as
  \code{mailx}.  A copy of the mail is sent to the current user.

  If method is \code{"gnuclient"}, then an emacs mail buffer is opened
  and used for sending the email.

  If method is \code{"none"} or \code{NULL} (which is the default on
  Windows systems), then only an editor is opened to help writing the
  bug report.  The report can then be copied to your favorite email
  program and be sent to the r-bugs list.

  If method is \code{"ess"} the body of the mail is simply sent to
  stdout.
  
  If wait is \code{"TRUE"} then \R issues a prompt after the editor is started
  and waits for input. If \R is sending the mail (e.g. with method
  code{"mailx"}) then wait should be \code{"TRUE"}. In this case the edited file
  must be saved before responding to the question.

\section{When is there a bug?}{
  If \R executes an illegal instruction, or dies with an operating
  system error message that indicates a problem in the program (as
  opposed to something like ``disk full''), then it is certainly a bug.

  Taking forever to complete a command can be a bug, but you must make
  certain that it was really \R's fault.  Some commands simply take a
  long time.  If the input was such that you KNOW it should have been
  processed quickly, report a bug.  If you don't know whether the
  command should take a long time, find out by looking in the manual or
  by asking for assistance.

  If a command you are familiar with causes an \R error message in a
  case where its usual definition ought to be reasonable, it is probably
  a bug.  If a command does the wrong thing, that is a bug.  But be sure
  you know for certain what it ought to have done.  If you aren't
  familiar with the command, or don't know for certain how the command
  is supposed to work, then it might actually be working right.  Rather
  than jumping to conclusions, show the problem to someone who knows for
  certain.

   Finally, a command's intended definition may not be best for
   statistical analysis.  This is a very important sort of problem, but
   it is also a matter of judgment.  Also, it is easy to come to such a
   conclusion out of ignorance of some of the existing features.  It is
   probably best not to complain about such a problem until you have
   checked the documentation in the usual ways, feel confident that you
   understand it, and know for certain that what you want is not
   available.  If you are not sure what the command is supposed to do
   after a careful reading of the manual this indicates a bug in the
   manual.  The manual's job is to make everything clear.  It is just as
   important to report documentation bugs as program bugs.

   If the online argument list of a function disagrees with the manual,
   one of them must be wrong, so report the bug.
}
\section{How to report a bug}{
  When you decide that there is a bug, it is important to report it and
  to report it in a way which is useful.  What is most useful is an
  exact description of what commands you type, from when you start \R
  until the problem happens.  Always include the version of \R, machine,
  and operating system that you are using; type `version' in \R to print
  this. 

  The most important principle in reporting a bug is to report FACTS,
  not hypotheses or categorizations.  It is always easier to report the
  facts, but people seem to prefer to strain to posit explanations and
  report them instead.  If the explanations are based on guesses about
  how \R is implemented, they will be useless; we will have to try to 
  figure out what the facts must have been to lead to such
  speculations.  Sometimes this is impossible.  But in any case, it is
  unnecessary work for us.

  For example, suppose that on a data set which you know to be quite
  large the command \code{data.frame(x, y, z, monday, tuesday)} never
  returns.  Do not report that \code{data.frame()} fails for large data
  sets.  Perhaps it fails when a variable name is a day of the week.  If
  this is so then when we got your report we would try out the
  \code{data.frame()} command on a large data set, probably with no day
  of the week variable name, and not see any problem. There is no way in
  the world that we could guess that we should try a day of the week
  variable name.

  Or perhaps the command fails because the last command you used was a
  \code{[} method that had a bug causing \R's internal data structures
  to be corrupted and making the \code{data.frame()} command fail from
  then on.  This is why we need to know what other commands you have
  typed (or read from your startup file).

  It is very useful to try and find simple examples that produce
  apparently the same bug, and somewhat useful to find simple examples
  that might be expected to produce the bug but actually do not.  If you
  want to debug the problem and find exactly what caused it, that is
  wonderful.  You should still report the facts as well as any
  explanations or solutions.

  Invoking \R with the \code{--vanilla} option may help in isolating a
  bug.  This ensures that the site profile and saved data files are not
  read.

  On some systems a bug report can be generated using the
  \code{bug.report()} function.  This automatically includes the version
  information and sends the bug to the correct address.  Alternatively
  the bug report can be emailed to \email{r-bugs@r-project.org} or
  submitted to the Web page at \url{http://bugs.r-project.org}.

   I'm now convinced it's because I had an apostrophe in the subject line
("round() doesn't").  The bug.report documentation specifically warns against
this, but the bug.report() function could also check for it!  I suggest adding
this line to the bug.report code:

  if (regexpr("'", subject) > 0) stop("Please, no apostrophe in the subject.")

Your problem may have been due to the apostrophe, but it reminded me of another
outstanding problem which I had neglected to report previously: wait=TRUE as in
the windows version seems to be necessary with some Unix editors too (e.g.
Nedit).

Hi R colleagues,

I don't know whether this is a bug, but something weird happen with R-GNOME.
Version 1.5.0.
I compiled the stuff under i-686 Linux RH 7.2 using ./configure --with-gnome.
R can be started with or without the Gnome interface: fine.
However, when I start with Gnome interface, jpeg and a few other 
things are unavailable (checked using capabilities()), whereas 
everything is available (except Gnome) when I start R without Gnome.
Also, some calls seem available with Gnome: system("..") returns nothing.
Maybe this is related to the experimental nature of the Gnome interface.
Hope that helps.
Cheers,
--

Have you actually tried them?  capabilities() can be wrong, as it only
reports what it is sure about.  For me under RH7.2 jpeg(), png() and X11()
do all work under R --gui=gnome.  (Well, actually gnome has problems with
its dialogs as it makes assumptions about the X11 system in use and I am
not using XFree86.)

I will try to work out a more definitive algorithm for capabilities, but
its main use is to test if checks should be run, so it needs to be
conservative.  And as you note, Gnome is experimental and has a separate
maintainer ....

jpeg() is available under the GNOME interface and works correctly.

The GNOME port currently uses the same version of do_system as the unix
command line port of R.  This sends the output of the system call to
the standard output.  So, for example, if you R-GNOME from a terminal,
the output will appear in the terminal and not the R GNOME console.
GNOME needs its own version of do_system.  I will fix this for R 1.5.1.

Subject: update() can not find objects

Full_Name: Yi-Xiong Zhou
Version: 1.5.1
OS: win2000pro
Submission from: (NULL) (64.169.249.42)


Update() can not find objects when it is used in a function, which is in turn
being called by another function. Here is a R script to show the problem:

######## begin of the test script ##########
fun1 <- function() {
   x <- matrix(rnorm(500), 20,25)
   y <- rnorm(20)
   oo <- lm(y~x)
   print("step 1")
   update(oo)
   print("first update success.")
   fun2(oo)
}

fun2 <- function(gg) {
   update(gg)
   print("second update success.")
}

fun1()
########### end of the test script #############

Here is the result of running this script:

[1] "step 1"
[1] "first update success."
Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos) : Object "y" not found

Ideally, update should first search the objects in its environment first, then
its parent's, and grand parent's environments ... Right now, it only searchs its
own environment and the global environment, skipping its parents'.

No, that's not what you should expect in a language with lexical scoping. 


However, there might still be a bug, since update with a non-missing
formula argument would extract the formula environment from the
formula stored in the lm object, but that doesn't happen if it is
missing. Modifying fun2 to

function(gg) {
   update(gg,formula(gg))
   print("second update success.")
}

or even

function(gg) {
   update(gg,y~x)
   print("second update success.")
}

does allow your example to run, which is somewhat unexpected...

Thanks Peter. This does work for formula. However, it failed to a function
call. Here is another test script:

################# begin test ###############
fun1 <- function() {
   x <- matrix(rnorm(500), 20,25)
   oo <- fun3(x)
   print("step 1")
   update(oo)
   print("first update success.")
   fun2(oo)
}

fun2 <- function(gg) {
   update(gg)
   print("second update success.")
}

fun3 <- function(aa) {
   oo <- list(x=aa, call=match.call())
   oo
}

fun1()
############### end test ############

The error message is 

[1] "step 1"
[1] "first update success."
Error in fun3(aa = x) : Object "x" not found

No, ideally it should search the objects in the environment where the
model was defined.  There's no guarantee that this is a grandparent, and
grandparents shouldn't be searched otherwise.  It might be tricky to get
this to work.

What isn't clear to me is whether the current environment should be
searched before the environment where the model was defined or afterwards.

Yes, but this isn't supposed to work, and can't.

In the first place update() is supposed to work on models, not on
arbitrary objects.

In the second place, the object you are returning contains no information
about where it was created, so it's not possible for update to work out
the correct environment.  In this case the correct environment happens to
be parent.frame(2), but there's no reason why this should be true in
general.


When the object is a model with a formula it does carry information about
where it was defined, so update() can look there.  Your first example
should have worked, and the fact that it didn't is a bug (though arguably
just a wishlist bug).  This new example shouldn't work.

Could an object carry the information about where it was created? Could that

Hi, there are two problems in devX11.c.  The one is an undocumented
nuisance and the other isn't a bug until you try to embed an X11
device in another window (think tktoplevel() in tcltk package...).

Let's take a look at locator() first: Assuming you call locator() with
a current X11 device, this call is handled in X11_Locator
(src/unix/X11/devX11.c).  When you have one window open and call
locator, you have three options to quit the locator: click Button 1
(to locate), click Button 2 (to abort), or destroy the window.  The
later results in the error message: "Error in locator(1) : No graphics
device is active". That's OK, sort of.

This gets problematic when you open two windows:
> x11()  # assume that's device 2
> x11()  # assume that's device 3
> plot(1)
> locator(1)  # with device 3 == dev.cur()!

When you now destroy device 3 (where locator expects the click), you have
*no alternative but to close _all_ windows* to abort the locator.  The
locator continues to wait for mouse clicks in device 3 where of course
no further clicks can come from.  That's the nuisance part.

The second problem is that the device may try to plot() into a
non-existant window.  Assume that the window was destroyed by some
other part of the program.  The device (at some point in the future)
will receive a DestroyNotify event that handleEvent ignores.
Blissfully!  *No KillDevice is called* when the window is destroyed by
something other than the WM_DELETE_WINDOW mechanism!  This happens
when you embed the X11 device into another window/application.  For
starters, the device no longer receives WM_DELETE_WINDOW client
messages.  But it does receive a DestroyNotify event when the parent
(the container window) is destroyed.  HandleEvent should, well
_handle_ this _event_.

The patch below is a _suggestion_ how to solve both problems.  It is
against the current r-devel, 1.3, as of 2/13.  I believe this behavior
exists in version 1.2 as well and can be solved there the same way.
The patch is just meant as a convenient and concise way to describe
my suggestion.  I'd greatly appreciate feedback or other ideas!

Implementation:

-- the variable inclose is now in the device specific structure (why
   was it global?)  After the window is mapped, inclose is TRUE until
   the window is destroyed explicitly or a DestroyNotify event has been
   received.
-- the deviceSpecific pointer is set to NULL after the memory has been
   freed. This (side?) effect is used in X11_Locator to detect the
   closing of the current device  which _must_ lead to an error.
-- the if statement to handle events of type DestroyEvent is added to 
   handleEvent
-- when the user closes the device (dev.off()), the window is
   destroyed in X11_Close
-- when the user pushes the close button in the window frame, the
   window is destroyed in handleEvent and X11_Close is initiated
   (the WM_DELETE_WINDOW mechanism already in place.)
-- when the window is destroyed for another reason (e.g. the parent
   being destroyed), it is not destroyed again but X11_Close is still
   initiated.

  -tom

Heh. Quite probably, this is also the source of the FVWM trouble
reported earlier although that triggered an infinite loop which should
probably be guarded against by other means as well. 

Thanks for filing this (good to have as bug report so that we don't
forget - it's the sort of thing that often has to wait until someone
has a clear enough mind and sufficient stamina to try and get it
right.)

I have a R function which call a C function by the instruction ".Call".
The first time I call the R function in a R session, it perfectly runs. But the
next 
times, R returns this error message :

Error in .Call("", bankpath, accn, indexpath, key, beg, end) :
        .Call function name not in load table

The function name has disappeared !!
This function well runs on Mandrake 7.2 but not in Mandrake 8.0. Why ?!?

Thanks for your answers...
PS : Excuse my poor english...

Hi Ludovic.

 There are at least two possible explanations for this behaviour.

  1)  There is a bug in the recently changed code in R to find 
     routines in C and Fortran libraries.

  2)  The routine that you are .Call()'ing is doing something
  that has confused the R internals and makes the next R commands
  not work, and potentially this is not reproducible.

If this is not proprietary or confidential code, you can send the C
code and instructions as to how to call it from R (that is, provide
simple values for the bankpath, accn, indexpath, key, beg and end
arguments), then I can see if the computations are potentially
writing over other values in memory.

Also, you can try a invoking a very simple .Call() routine 
many times to see if that displays the same failure. For example,
put the following C code in a file named simpleCall.c

#include "Rinternals.h"

SEXP
simpleCall() 
{
  static int count = 0;
  SEXP ans;

  PROTECT(ans = allocVector(INTSXP, 1));
  INTEGER(ans)[0] = count++;

  UNPROTECT(1);
  return(ans);
}

Then, compile this with 
  R CMD SHLIB simpleCall.c

and call it from R in the following way

 > dyn.load("simpleCall.so")
 > for(i in 1:10) { print(.Call("simpleCall")) }

If this works, it won't determine whether it is 1) or 2) (or any other
possible reason), but if it doesn't work, we will have a lot more
information.

 Thanks,
   Duncan

Found it on the site.
I tried duncan's suggestion.

#include "Rinternals.h"

SEXP
simpleCall()
{
  static int count = 0;
  SEXP ans;

  PROTECT(ans = allocVector(INTSXP, 1));
  INTEGER(ans)[0] = count++;

  UNPROTECT(1);
  return(ans);
}


If I had read this before I could have checked on mandrake 8.0

Here is my output on mandrake 8.1:

Subject: R 1.3.1 fails 'make check' on arm in the Bessel example
X-Mailer: VM 6.92 under 21.4 (patch 1) "Copyleft" XEmacs Lucid
From: Dirk Eddelbuettel <edd@debian.org>


Debian tries to build its packages on a variety of platforms.  The arm
platform compiled 0.90.1 (the last Debian release before the Debian package
required an Atlas library, something we no longer require) failed in 'make
check'. The log snippet follows; I traced this to the example(Bessel) code.
 
> matplot(nu, t(outer(xx,nu, besselI)), type = 'l', ylim = c(-50,200),
+         main = expression(paste("Bessel ",I[nu](x)," for fixed ", x,
+                                 ",  as ",f(nu))),
+         xlab = expression(nu))
Error in title(main = main, sub = sub, xlab = xlab, ylab = ylab, ...) :
        Metric information not yet available for this device
        In addition: Warning messages:
        1: Nonfinite axis limits [GScale(nan,nan,1, .); log=0]
        2: relative range of values = 9.0072e+15 * EPS, is small (axis 1).
        3: Nonfinite axis limits [GScale(-inf,inf,2, .); log=0]
        4: relative range of values = 9.0072e+15 * EPS, is small (axis 2).
        Execution halted

Casual inspection suggests that GScale(nan,nan,1, .) is probably
incorrect. Now, src/nmath/bessel* provide the Bessel functions but does this
reflect a potential libc bug in IEEE handling?

I have also asked on the debian-arm mailing list, but no result so far. I
have some access to an arm box and could compile small test cases if that
helped.

This looks like a bug?
Unable to use scan(pipe()) while profiling.
I have no idea whether this version of R violates the
    "do not use `Rprof' in an executable built for profiling"
warning in ?Rprof.

Thanks

This does not happen on Solaris or Linux, so must be related to the use of
signals on darwin.

It probably means Rprof should be avoided on that platform, but the
porter (Jan de Leeuw) needs to investigate.

This feels like a system call restarting issue.  Some OS's restart
system calls after signals, others do not. For those that don't, low
level reads need to check for EINTR and such.  Connections use high
level reads, which should be insulated by the stdio library.  Possibly
dawrin's gets this wrong.  If strace is available you might be able to
tell that way.

Jan,
Here is information on the problem with Rprof() that I encountered, 
including Brian Ripley's assessment.
This is OS X 10.1 with the 10.1 developer tools installed.

   I've compiled R verison 1.3.1 on SGI Irix 6.5

   It fails its check when running the ts-Ex.Rout test with:

=====
> 
> data(BJsales)
> ar(ts.union(BJsales, BJsales.lead))
Error in ar.yw.mts(x, aic = aic, order.max = order.max, na.action =
na.action,  : 
        On entry to DGEMM  parameter number 1 had an illegal value
Execution halted
=====

   It was compiled with gcc 2.95.2 (and the g77 which came with that,
which is 0.5.25).

Subject: Update on report PR#1145 (with a cross-reference to PR#1026).
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

   The original report was that compiling with gcc2.95.2 gcc and the
related g77 on Irix 6.,5.13 produced an R which wailed its tests with:

>> On entry to DGEMM  parameter number 1 had an illegal value

   To some extend this confused me, as the source only seems to mention
DGEMM in lowercase.  Eventually, after the debug code I added did
nothing, I realized that the R which was build was not using the
src/appl/blas.f source file: it was using the SGI libblas.

   My suspicion is that this is the cause.  The man page for this
mentions there is a C interface for dgemm but that it uses an enumerated
variable for the first 2 parameters in place of character strings.  I
thing things got mixed up somewhere along the line (perhaps with the
number of "_" appended to external symbils?).

   So, I tried configuring while adding "--without-blas" to the config  
options. This resulted in a SIGSEGV in the modreg test.  (See bug report
PR#1026, which also mentions this).

   So, a further try, this time using the compilers, cc anf f77 while  
still specifying "--without-blas" (so that the SGI libblas is ignored).

   This ran through the tests without crashing.  There were a few minor
differences in the print-tests output, but all at the "0 vs.  10**-300"
level, ie: floating point inaccuracies (which I presume are Ok and any
good statistician will ignore?).

Dear colleagues,

>I use R under RH Linux 7.2 on a i686 PIII 733 machine.

I have a problem to install packages since R 1.4.0 has been installed.

>finding all html,and other help files.
>However, it ends up with DONE INSTALL, and when you type

I have also tried R CMD check which runs correctly and finds all files.

Couldn't it be a general problem with the new binaries of R 1.4.0 and RH 7.2?
Any hint welcome, of course, because I have spend many many hours to 
try to fix that.

Subject: eigen segfault with GCC 3 on Solaris
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

A message this morning reminded me of a previous problem I had which should be
noted in R bugs, but is really a problem with gcc 3 I believe. It may be only a
problem on Solaris, but AFAIK has not been checked on other platforms. I
resolved it by going back to a gcc 2.9x.x (which a few people suggested). Below
is the relevant part of my original post, an example which provokes the
segfault, and some gdb information from Peter Dalgaard.

PG>I have now tested R 1.3.1 compiled with GCC 3.0.2 on Solaris and the example
I
PG>previously posted (repeated below) still gives a segmentation fault, as it
does
PG>with GCC 3.0.1 but not with 2.95.2. The eigen calculation sometimes needs to
be
PG> repeated several times before the segmentation fault occurs. La.eigen does
not
PG> cause a problem. (The problem occurred with R-devel too, but I have not
tested
PG> that with GCC 3.0.2.)

PD>I don't know if it helps, but I see it too... 3.0.1 on Solaris 2.7.
PD>
PD>gdb says that it is happening at l.2144 of eigen.f:
PD>
PD>2142    C
PD>2143                DO 760 J = M, EN
PD>2144                   RA = RA + H(I,J) * H(J,NA)
PD>2145                   SA = SA + H(I,J) * H(J,EN)
PD>2146      760       CONTINUE
PD>2147    C
PD>
PD>J prints as 7289784 for me, which looks a bit weird since M and EN are
PD>17 and 18 respectively. However, optimizers sometimes cause this sort
PD>of thing.

That looks like a problem in the gcc compiler suite. You might try
upgrading the compiler. Sometimes changing compiler flags (you would
only need to do it for the offending module) does the trick. 

Another possibility is that gcc is generating code that the system
assembler doesn't understand (this is happening with gcc 3 on
Solaris). If so, then you might install GNU binutils.

If none of this helps, I'm afraid that you need to take it up with the
GCC authors since it is not an R problem.

I neglected to mention that 
gcc -v gives:

Here is a more verbose output if that helps:

Subject: R 1.4.0 build fails on AIX

Full_Name: Daniel L. Million
Version: 1.4.0
OS: AIX 5.1 and 4.3.3
Submission from: (NULL) (160.91.192.125)


Is there any guidance available on building R on AIX?  Specifically, which C 
compiler to use?  We have AIX XL Fortran version 7.1.1.  We also have AIX 
Visual Age C version 5.0.2.  We also have gcc available.

I have tried building with "cc" (the default AIX compiler) and "gcc".  During
the "make", C compilation in src/library/methods/src completes, and then I 
see this:

mkdir ../../../../library/methods/libs
dumping R code in package `methods'
make: 1254-059 The signal code from the last command is 11.

Apparently the make is running R.bin, which coredumps with a segmentation
violation.

Do I need to be using a thread-safe compiler (e.g., "cc_r") for this build?
Any clues at all as to how to get around this?

Thanks.

Dan Million

I have successfully built most recent versions of R including 1.4.0 with
gcc/g77 and with "C for AIX version 5"/"XL Fortran for AIX" on AIX 4.3. I
haven't been able to mix the GNU and IBM compilers, but I haven't tried
recently.  Last week I compiled R-patched successfully using gcc/g77. I
didn't have to do anything special, but AIX has often been source of
configuration bugs.

You could try not building the methods package: edit  Makeconf in the top
R/ directory and remove methods from R_PKGS.

Also, I think that it's possible to have the methods package build in the
usual source form rather than as a saved image. I don't know how, but John
Chambers or Duncan Temple Lang may be able to help.

These wouldn't actually fix the problem, but would enable you to compile
everything else.

I'll try again with the AIX compilers and the new R 1.4.1. It's possible
that there have been some changes since I last tried, since I usually do
this shortly before a release.

Thanks for the reply.  I tried building without the modules package, and
got past that point.  Now the build fails trying to link tcltk.so.  Seems
the tclConfig.sh on my host refers to a file that does not exist
(/opt/freeware/src/packages/BUILD/tcltk-8.3.3/tcl8.3.3/unix/lib.exp).

I'll freely admit to being clueless about most of this.  I don't know
anything about R; I'm just a sysadmin trying to build/install it for a
user who needs it.

Our autodetection of tcl/tk is less reliable than most stuff, partly
because the tclConfig.sh and similar files are sometimes inaccurate.  If
your users don't need tcl/tk (which is a fairly low-level set of
facilities for writing GUIs) you can again remove tcltk from the R_PKGS
line of Makeconf, or reconfigure
   ./configure --without-tcltk

If your users do need this package then you (or they) need to track down
where tcl and tk lurk and provide this information to R. Probably the
easiest way would be to install a new version of Tcl and Tk, which should
produce an honest set of configuration files.

I installed and built the Tcl/Tk source RPM, and now the file that R wants
is there.  By skipping the "modules" packages, the build gets all the way
to the end.

"make check" fails rather quickly:

    running code in `base-Ex.R' .../bin/sh: 51598 Illegal
	instruction(coredump)
    make: 1254-004 The error code from the last command is 1.

When I try to run R, I get the opening info and then a "> " prompt.
I can type simple commands like help(), but whenever I type q() to
quit, I get a coredump.  This is consistent with what I saw earlier when
the build was trying to load "modules".  The stack trace in the coredump
contains this:

Segmentation fault in spin_lock_global_ppc_mp at 0xd0106644 ($t1)
0xd0106644 (spin_lock_global_ppc_mp+0x24) 7ce5192d     stwcx.   r7,r5,r3

exit(??) at 0xd0177c40
Rstd_CleanUp(0x3, 0x0, 0x1), line 529 in "sys-std.c"

It almost looks like R is working OK until it calls "exit", and then it
blows up.

Submission from: (NULL) (160.91.192.125)


R almost works if I build on AIX without the R shared library (except for
crashing
on exit and a few other anomalies).  I can't get it to do much at all if I
build
with --enable-R-shlib.

For example, it won't load the X11 driver.  I ran R in a debugger and traced it
down to the point where R_load_X11_shlib successfully loads the R_X11.so
library
and calls R_init_X11.  This calls R_setX11Routines in src/unix/X11.c.  On entry

to this function, ptr_X11DeviceDriver = 0x2002eb20 and dev = 0x2014ba08.  After
the statement

    ptr_X11DeviceDriver = dev;

is executed, ptr_X11DeviceDriver remains unchanged at 0x2002eb20 !!  So when I
type "X11()" at the R prompt, all I ever get is the stub message, "the x11
device
has not been loaded".

I don't know enough about how shared libraries interact to understand why this
pointer is apparently write-protected.  I'm hoping someone here can give me a
clue.

Actually, we'd be very grateful if you could run these with
R-devel aka "R pre1.5.0" instead.

You can get a snapshot using rsync (or the tar file), see
    http://stat.ethz.ch/CRAN/sources.html

If you see the same problem (or also with 1.4.1)
look at the tests/d-p-q files
probably start R and try things like

 z <- c(-Inf,Inf,NA,NaN, rt(1000, df=2))
 z.ok <- z > -37.5 | !is.finite(z)
 for(df in 1:10)
    if(!is.logical(all.equal(pt(z, df), 1 - pt(-z,df), tol= 1e-15)))
      cat("ERROR -- df = ", df, "\n")

 c(pz <- pnorm(z), 1 - pnorm(z, lower=FALSE))
 c(pz, pnorm(-z, lower=FALSE))
 c(log(pz[z.ok]),  pnorm(z[z.ok], log=TRUE))


because these are around line 315 of tests/d-p-q-r-tests.Rout.save
and the second problem happened around there.

[A more desperate option would be to offer a login into your computer to
 someone from the R core team ...]

Thanks for helping us to have R running correctly on OpenBSD 3.0,
Martin

Hitting ^C breaks readline history (when R is stared in an xterm).

xterm -e R
^C    -> arrow key and history stop working.
For example, up-arrow gives "^[[A".

Yes, I've noticed as well. However, press Enter and things return to
normal.

If you give us a clue as to what causes the problem, we might fix it...

Thanks,
that's much better than my previous solution (quit and restart R).

Probably something wrong with readline and/or ncurses but currently I
don't know exactly what...

During resizing of 'R Console' windows the fatal error of forbidden memory
access appears.
To reproduce that with a guaranty, resize windows by mouse with small steps.
Probably the faster computer is, the earlier that event appears. I have PIV 1.8
GHz.
Waiting time was near 1 second.

Thank you for great product.

Sorry, I cannot reproduce that on Windows XP, on either a P4 1.4MHz
or an AthlonXP 1800.  If it were a common problem I am sure we would hear
about it often.

Why are you resizing the console at all?  You can set a suitable size in
the preferences.

I can reproduce it in Win98 on a fairly slow machine.  It looks to me
as though the routine that's handling the WM_SIZE messages is being
interrupted by the new resize requests, and eventually the stack
overflows.  It would be best to ignore such requests while one is
active.  I don't understand graphapp well enough to know where to fix
this.

Full_Name: Mark Bravington
Version: 1.5.0
OS: Windows 2000
Submission from: (NULL) (140.79.2.3)


In R1.3.1, I used the following code inside a function to set a "path" attribute
to .GlobalEnv:

  env_ pos.to.env( 1)
  attr( env, 'path')_ .Path # .Path is a named char vector of length 1
  .Internal( lib.fixup( env, .GlobalEnv)) # adds the attribute

And this works fine. But in R1.5.0, the same code (executed e.g. within a call
to "local" from the command line) removes all the objects in .GlobalEnv (note,
though, that the 'path' attribute does get set OK). For various reasons, this
feature is crucial to me, so I can't actually use R1.5.0 without it!

Oddly, my code used to explicitly set a path attribute for newly-attached things
using this mechanism, and this has now been incorporated into R1.5.0 "library"
command. So I'm clearly not doing anything naughty here!

A suggestion: wouldn't it be easier if we could use

attr( env, <<whatever>>) # where env is an environment

and

attr( env, <<whatever>>)_ 45

instead of having to go via "lib.fixup"?

cheers

lib.fixup

My previous post mentions a problem encountered when calling ".Internal(
lib.fixup..." in R1.5.0. I have since found a workaround. It's possible in
R1.5.0 to set attributes of search path environments directly, like so:

> env_ pos.to.env( 3)
> attr( env, 'any.attr')_ 'any.value'
> pos.to.env( 3)
<environment: package:tcltk>
attr(,"name")
[1] "package:tcltk"
attr(,"path")
[1] "C:/R/rw1050/library/tcltk"
attr(,"any.attr")
[1] "any.value"

In R1.3.1, it used to be necessary to use lib.fixup to achieve this. It's
still not possible to call

> attr( pos.to.env( 3), 'any.attr')_ 'any.value'

directly, but this doesn't matter. My (mis-typed) wish-lish-suggestion in
the last post, is therefore irrelevant, and personally I no longer need
lib.fixup. NB that it can still cause problems if it is used-- but as it's
undocumented, I don't suppose this will be a major issue.

Nevertheless, calls to ".Internal( lib.fixup..." are not things of beauty,
and I wonder whether the current usage in "library" is actually necessary?
The code currently reads

            loadenv <- new.env(hash = TRUE, parent = .GlobalEnv)
            <<...>>
                sys.source(codeFile, loadenv, keep.source = keep.source)
            <<...>>
            env <- attach(NULL, name = pkgname)
            on.exit(do.call("detach", list(name = pkgname)))
            attr(env, "path") <- file.path(which.lib.loc, package)
            .Internal(lib.fixup(loadenv, env))
            
but I seem to get satisfactory results with

      env_ attach( NULL, name = pkgname)
      on.exit(do.call("detach", list(name = pkgname)))            
      attr( env, "path") <- file.path(which.lib.loc, package)
      <<...>>
          sys.source(codeFile, env, keep.source = keep.source) # i.e.
straight into "env" not into "loadenv"
      <<...>>
      
which does away with the calls to "new.env" and "lib.fixup". As far as I can
see, the "parent=.GlobalEnv" argument to "new.env" doesn't have any effect
after "lib.fixup"; I'm not sure about the "hash=TRUE".

cheers
Mark

Hi All,

A colleague has just pointed out to me prcomp is *much* slower and memory
intensive when applied to very wide matrixes than when applied to the
transpose of the same matrix.  In looking for the reason, I discovered that
that the singular value decomposition function svd is the primary culprit:

On my Solaris workstation, under R 1.5.1:

	>  nr <- 50
	>  nc <- 1000
	>  x  <- matrix( rnorm( nr*nc), nrow=nr, ncol=nc )
	>  tx <- t(x)
	>
	> # SVD directly on matrix is SLOW
	>  system.time( val.x <- svd(x)$u )
	[1] 5.41 0.00 5.62 0.00 0.00
	>
	> # SVD directly on t(matrix) is FAST
	>  system.time( val.tx <- svd(tx)$v )
	[1] 0.60 0.00 0.61 0.00 0.00
	>

The speed difference gets worse as the number of columns grows.  

Here is a simple patch to $R_SRC/src/library/base/R/svd.R that works around
the problem.  It simply checks whether the matrix is wider than it is long,
and if so, calls itself on the transpose of the matrix, and then exchanges
the returned u and v matrixes.


*** svd.R.orig Tue Jul  9 11:06:46 2002
--- svd.R Tue Jul  9 11:06:49 2002
***************
*** 5,10 ****
--- 5,17 ----
      n <- dx[1]
      p <- dx[2]
      if(!n || !p) stop("0 extent dimensions")
+ 
+     if( p > n )  # compute on the transpose if wide
+       {
+         s <- svd( t(x), nv=nu, nu=nv)
+         return( d=s$d, u=s$v, v=s$u )
+       }
+     
      if (is.complex(x)) {
          res <- La.svd(x, nu, nv)
          return(list(d = res$d, u = if(nu) res$u, v = if(nv)
Conj(t(res$vt))))


With this patch the speed is almost the same whether called on x or tx:

	> system.time( val.x <- svd(x)$u )
	[1] 0.62 0.00 0.66 0.00 0.00

	> system.time( val.tx <- svd(tx)$v )
	[1] 0.60 0.00 0.86 0.00 0.00

	> identical( val.x, val.tx )
	[1] TRUE

This is fine for my purposes, but perhaps someone familiar with the FORTRAN
code should see why its performance is so unbalanced.

Subject: Rwave installation problem

Full_Name: Linc Davis
Version: 1.5.1
OS: Mac OS 10.1.5
Submission from: (NULL) (68.4.90.94)


When running install.packages("Rwave") as root, I got this error:

In file included from compinteg.c:12:
kernel.h:22: malloc.h: No such file or directory
make: *** [compinteg.o] Error 1
ERROR: compilation failed for package 'Rwave'

There are 3 header files 'malloc.h' in Mac OS X: one for generic C, one for
Objective-C, and a private one for the OS. The R installation script looks for C
headers in /usr/include, but the actual path to this one is

/usr/include/sys/malloc.h

I worked around the problem by copying the file as indicated, then I deleted the
copy after compiling the package. To fix the bug, the script should be changed
to look for C headers in both /usr/include and /usr/include/sys.

Thanks.

I recently reported order() to ignore decreasing=TRUE with na.last=NA.
Now I discovered two other problems and send corrected code.

Best regards


Jens Oehlschlägel


# PROBLEM 1 see PR#1906


# PROBLEM 2
> order(1, na.last=NA)
Error in apply(sapply(z, is.na), 1, any) : 
        dim(X) must have a positive length
# clearly wrong as
> order(1)
[1] 1
# is defined


# PROBLEM 3
> order(c(NA, NA), na.last=NA)
Error in order(c(NA, NA), na.last = NA) : all elements contain an NA
# The help file promises ordering indices to all non-NA elements. 
# Thus, if all elements are NA, consequently the result should be integer(0)
# The prototype also returns integer(0) and additionally gives a warning
from sort.list()


# Here are fixes for all three problems

# save old version for comparision below
old.order <- order  


order <- function (..., na.last = TRUE, decreasing = FALSE)
{
    if (!is.na(na.last)) 
        .Internal(order(na.last, decreasing, ...))
    else {
        z <- list(...)
        if (any(diff(sapply(z, length)) != 0)) 
            stop("Argument lengths differ")
        ok <- !apply(matrix(sapply(z, is.na), nrow=length(z[[1]]),
ncol=length(z)), 1, any)  # make shure the result of sapply is a matrix
        if (all(!ok)){
            # stop("all elements contain an NA")	# don't turn all-NA into a
stop error
            return(integer(0))				# don't turn all-NA into a stop error
        }
        z[[1]][!ok] <- NA
        z[["decreasing"]] <- decreasing  		# put decreasing= into parameters
passed to next call of order
        ans <- do.call("order", z)
        keep <- seq(length = sum(ok))  			# simplify and (theoretical) speed
up
        ans[keep]					# simplify and (theoretical) speed up
    }
}

x1 <- rep(1, 3)
x2 <- c(1, NA, 2)
order(x1, x2)
old.order(x1, x2)
order(x1, x2, decreasing=TRUE)
old.order(x1, x2, decreasing=TRUE)

old.order(x1, x2, na.last=NA)
order(x1, x2, decreasing=TRUE, na.last=NA)
old.order(x1, x2, decreasing=TRUE, na.last=NA)

order(1, na.last=NA)
old.order(1, na.last=NA)

order(c(NA, NA), na.last=NA)
old.order(c(NA, NA), na.last=NA)
