<h1 class="title">Setting up a virtual machine to check R packages</h1>
<p class="author">Tomas Kalibera</p>
</header>
<p>This document describes how to get and set up a virtual machine running Windows in which one may build and check R packages and R itself. It uses a free virtual machine provided by Microsoft for testing (with a 90-day limit, see below). The installation is automated via Vagrant. The VM is set up for ssh access (command line use) and RDP access (both command line and graphics), with <code>bash</code> and command line tools to install and build R.</p>
<p>This setup was created primarily to help package developers normally working on Linux or macOS who don’t have access to Windows, but want to test or debug their packages on Windows. The document only covers the UCRT toolchain, but the VM could easily be used for building also using other toolchains.</p>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>The process requires a good network connection. The amount of data downloaded on installation, including the toolchain, may be close to 10G. On a slow connection, one may have to re-start the process, see “Troubleshooting” below. Also, please be prepared that the error message from <code>unzip</code> may be confusing when the downloaded file is incomplete, which in turn may be hard to notice when downloading via system GUI. This is a message one may get on an incomplete file:</p>
<pre><code>Archive:  MSEdge.Win10.Vagrant.zip
  End-of-central-directory signature not found.  Either this file is not
  a zipfile, or it constitutes one disk of a multi-part archive.  In the
  latter case the central directory and zipfile comment will be found on
  the last disk(s) of this archive.</code></pre>

</ul>
<h3 id="other-systems">Other systems</h3>
<p>Similar installation instructions should work on other systems running on 64-bit Intel. The <code>Vagrantfile</code> script has hard-coded path for the user’s RSA key, which may need to be changed e.g. on a Windows host. Also, after small adaptations, this should work with other virtualization software than VirtualBox (e.g. VMWare, Hyper-V, Parallels). A different Windows VM may require bigger changes.</p>
<h2 id="using-the-vm">Using the VM</h2>
<h3 id="logging-in">Logging in</h3>
<p>One can log in to the VM from the console using SSH without password using</p>
<pre><code>vagrant ssh</code></pre>
<p>to get <code>cmd.exe</code> shell.</p>
<p>To get <code>bash</code>, run:</p>
<pre><code>chcp 437 &amp; set MSYSTEM=MSYSTEM &amp; &quot;c:\msys64\usr\bin\bash.exe&quot; --login -i</code></pre>
<p>The SSH access is convenient for command line utilities and is enough to install R, build R, install and build probably most R packages. It also allows to install the virtual machine on say a remote Linux server where one can only connect via SSH without graphical interface. But, the SSH interface does not work for applications that need graphical interface. The <code>chcp 437</code> command above is to set the default code page, otherwise it is zero in the SSH session on this version of Windows, which causes MiKTeX to crash (<a href="https://github.com/MiKTeX/miktex/issues/931">this issue</a>).</p>
<p>For a full graphical interface, one may log in using RDP via</p>
<pre><code>vagrant rdp -- /cert-ignore</code></pre>
<p>which invokes an external RDP client. If such a client is not available or does not work, one can always log in directly via virtualbox: run <code>virtualbox</code>, find the running virtual machine in the list, choose <code>Show</code>. The default VM username is <code>IEUser</code> and password <code>Passw0rd!</code>.</p>
<p>It is also possible to use a regular ssh client on port 2222 and regular/other RDP client on the default port of the host machine.</p>
<h3 id="booting-shutting-down-etc.">Booting, shutting down, etc.</h3>
<p>Like a real computer, the virtual machine has state saved on a (virtual) hard-disk, so when suspended or shut down properly, the state is preserved across reboots of the guest as well as the host machine.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>vagrant halt # shuts down gracefully the machine</code></li>
<li><code>vagrant up  # boots the machine up</code></li>
<li><code>vagrant suspend</code></li>
<li><code>vagrant resume</code></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, one can save the machine state, export it, etc. Note that not all operations technically possible are necessarily allowed by the license terms under which Microsoft distributes the VM.</p>
<p>The directory with the Vagrant file (<code>win10-tst</code>) is accessible from the guest VM as <code>C:\vagrant</code>, even in the SSH sessions.</p>
<h3 id="installing-and-running-r">Installing and running R</h3>
<p>To install the current R-devel patched for UCRT, get a bash prompt (already assumed later on)</p>
<pre><code>vagrant ssh
chcp 437 &amp; set MSYSTEM=MSYSTEM &amp; &quot;c:\msys64\usr\bin\bash.exe&quot; --login -i</code></pre>
<p>and run</p>
<pre><code>wget -np -nd -r -l1 -A &#39;R-devel-win-[0-9]*.exe&#39; https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/winutf8/ucrt3
./R-devel-win*.exe //VERYSILENT //SUPPRESSMSGBOXES</code></pre>
<p>Note that the command above downloads whatever is the current installer for R-devel. Part of the file name are numbers identifying the version, and there is always only (the latest) available for download, hence the wildcards. If you are re-running this command, you may want to first delete the old installer you have downloaded previously and uninstall the previous version of R (see e.g. unins000.exe in the installed R tree).</p>
<p>Now, run R via <code>/c/Program\ Files/R/R-devel/bin/R</code>. A sample <code>sessionInfo()</code>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; sessionInfo() 
R Under development (unstable) (2021-03-14 r80087)

<p>The VM is running Windows 10, but a version that is too old to have UTF-8 as the current system encoding. Hence, R is running with Latin-1 as the native encoding.</p>
<h2 id="installing-packages-binary-not-needing-compilation">Installing packages (binary, not needing compilation)</h2>
<p>In R, run e.g.</p>
<pre><code>options(menu.graphics=FALSE)
install.packages(&quot;PKI&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>The options change is needed, otherwise R will open a graphical windows asking to choose a CRAN mirror, but that Window will not appear when logged in via SSH. A similar caveat is that one cannot use currently the R help system when logged via SSH. These precautions are not necessary with RDP or direct graphical access using Virtualbox.</p>
<h2 id="installing-the-toolchain">Installing the toolchain</h2>
<p>The compiler toolchain is needed to install from source packages which need compilation.</p>
<p>There are two ways to do it, one using RTools42, which is almost the same as with RTools4 and the standard MSVCRT builds of R. For that, the instructions are available in [[1]]((https://svn.r-project.org/R-dev-web/trunk/WindowsBuilds/winutf8/ucrt3/howto.html).</p>
<p>This text and the underlying setup, instead, show how to install the toolchain manually when there are already build tools available (this set up installs Msys2). To manually install and set up the full version of the toolchain, without the build tools, from bash:</p>
<pre><code>wget -np -nd -r -l1 -A &#39;gcc10*full*.tar.zst&#39; https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/winutf8/ucrt3
tar xf gcc10*full*.tar.zst

export R_CUSTOM_TOOLS_SOFT=`pwd`/x86_64-w64-mingw32.static.posix
export PATH=$R_CUSTOM_TOOLS_SOFT/bin:$PATH
export PATH=~/AppData/Local/Programs/MiKTeX/miktex/bin/x64:$PATH
export TAR=&quot;/usr/bin/tar&quot;
export TAR_OPTIONS=&quot;--force-local&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Again, there is only one version of the toolchain available at a time and the file name includes the version numbers. If you are re-running this command, please delete first the old version of the toolchain archive and the unpacked directory.</p>
<p>It makes sense to save the settings of environment variables to a file, say named <code>e</code> and then include it via <code>. e</code> after logging in, when needed.</p>
<p>To check the paths are set correctly:</p>
<pre><code>which gcc pdflatex
# /c/Users/IEUser/x86_64-w64-mingw32.static.posix/bin/gcc
# /c/Program Files/MiKTeX/miktex/bin/x64/pdflatex</code></pre>
<h2 id="installing-packages-that-need-compilation">Installing packages that need compilation</h2>
<p>With the environment variables from above, run in R e.g.</p>
<pre><code>options(menu.graphics=FALSE)
install.packages(&quot;PKI&quot;, type=&quot;source&quot;)</code></pre>
<h2 id="building-r-from-source">Building R from source</h2>
<p>Download R, the R patch for UCRT and Tcl/Tk bundle (from bash):</p>
<pre><code>wget -np -nd -r -l1 -A &#39;R-devel-*.diff&#39; https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/winutf8/ucrt3
RVER=`ls -1 R-devel-*.diff | sed -e &#39;s/R-devel-\([0-9]\+\)-.*diff/\1/g&#39;`
svn checkout -r $RVER https://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk
wget https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/winutf8/ucrt3/Tcl.zip</code></pre>
<p>In the above, we first download the current patch for R devel, get the svn version of R from the patch name, and then checkout R devel of that version.</p>
<p>Now to build it:</p>
<pre><code>cd trunk
patch --binary -p0 &lt; ../R-devel-*.diff
unzip ../Tcl.zip

cd src/gnuwin32
cat &lt;&lt;EOF &gt;MkRules.local
ISDIR = C:/Program Files (x86)/InnoSetup
EOF

make rsync-recommended
make all recommended 2&gt;&amp;1 | tee make.out</code></pre>
<p>One can also build the R installer using <code>make distribution</code>.</p>
<h2 id="installing-other-command-line-tools">Installing other command line tools</h2>
<p>One may install additional command-line programs from Msys2. For instance to get the VIM editor, run (VIM works even in SSH sessions):</p>
<pre><code>pacman -S vim</code></pre>
<p>Useful pacman commands:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>pacman -Syu # upgrade packages</code></li>
<li><code>pacman -Fy # install file index</code></li>
<li><code>pacman -F unzip.exe # find package providing unzip.exe</code></li>
<li><code>pacman -Q # list installed packages</code></li>
<li><code>pacman -Sl # list available (even not installed) packages</code></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<p>If something goes wrong during installation of the machine, the initial <code>vagrant up</code> invocation, one may restart the process in this order via <code>vagrant up</code>, <code>vagrant up --provision</code>, <code>vagrant reload</code>. The scripts are written to re-use what is already installed in the machine. Restarting the provisioning in particular should help on a slow network connection, when some of the scripts time out (tested on one machine with throttled network and based on reports from people who experienced problems).</p>
<p>A radical step is to destroy the machine completely via <code>vagrant destroy</code> and then re-try via <code>vagrant up</code>. This destroys everything installed into the virtual machine.</p>
<p>If that does not help, one might have to read the outputs and debug, or find a way around it, e.g. just use the machine via virtualbox GUI, which should always work. Also one may run some of the steps manually in the VM and then re-start the provisioning.</p>
<p>By default, the VM is configured to have 2 CPUs and 4G of RAM, which should allow running it on most today’s laptops, but this could be increased on systems with more resources for better performance. One way to do this manually from VirtualBox Manager when the VM is not running: look for VM named win10-tst, choose Settings, System.</p>
<p>If MiKTeX stops working, returning “Access denied.” error (and in graphical interface, also a dialog “This app can’t run on your PC”), reinstalling MiKTeX manually from the graphical inteface might help, but one might have to delete some of the MiKTeX files manually.</p>
<h2 id="technical-details-and-limitations-of-the-vm">Technical details and limitations of the VM</h2>
<p>The VM should only be run in a secure environment where adversary connection even to the host machine is not possible, because access to the VM cannot be regarded as secure: it has a default password and user, it disables NLA so that older RDP servers can connect, it forwards ports from the host machine. Note that by default, the guest machine can access the host file system as well (the directory with the VM configuration), so as set up now it cannot be regarded as a secure sandbox.</p>
<p>The scripts for automated installation are fragile to external software site changes. It is very likely that download locations and file names for say MiKTeX will stop working in the near future as it already happened once, but fixing that should not be hard.</p>
<p>In principle, there is also WinRM connection to the VM (<code>vagrant winrm</code>) using which the provisioning is started, enabling SSH, enabling RDP, installing files, etc.</p>
<p>The <code>Vagrantfile</code> can be customized so that it does not automatically check/upgrade virtualbox guest additions on provisioning, to save time/bandwidth.</p>
<p>There is the 90-day limit of this free virtual machine. One may log into the graphical interface and see detailed license information at the Windows desktop background. It also says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Create a snapshot (or keep a backup of downloaded archive) before first booting and working with this VM, so that you can reset quickly after the OS trial expires).”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It has been reported that after the 90-day limit expires, the machine automatically shuts down after 1 hour of use, but it is non-trivial to see the reason when using it via SSH or RDP. If you experience similar problems, it is worth checking that the machine license has not expired.</p>
