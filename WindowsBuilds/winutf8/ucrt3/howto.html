<h1 id="howto-utf-8-as-native-encoding-in-r-on-windows">Howto: UTF-8 as native encoding in R on Windows</h1>
<p>For UTF-8 as native encoding on Windows, we need a new compiler toolchain using UCRT as C runtime and we have to rebuild all native code with it: R, packages with native code and libraries used by those. Some of that code needs patching (for UCRT, for newer toolchain, etc).</p>
<p>We also need to adapt our code to work with multi-byte encodings where it may previously have expected single-byte or double-byte encodings. Sooner we find about these problems and fix them, sooner we can enjoy UTF-8 in R on Windows.</p>
<p>This document describes how to get things started to help with testing. Regular CRAN checks (kind gcc10-UCRT) are being run using the experimental toolchain described here.</p>
<h2 id="binary-installer-of-r-binary-packages">Binary installer of R, binary packages</h2>
<p>One needs recent Windows 10 (May 2019 Update). The binary installer is available <a href="https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/winutf8/ucrt3/">here</a> in a file named such as <code>R-devel-win-79604-4354-4361.exe</code>. Make sure that this version of R-devel gets its own library of R packages, it is not possible to share the library with a usual build of R-devel. Only 64-bit version is available.</p>
<p>To check UTF-8 is used as native encoding, run</p>
<pre><code>&gt; l10n_info()
$MBCS
[1] TRUE

$`UTF-8`
[1] TRUE

$`Latin-1`
[1] FALSE

$codepage
[1] 65001

$system.codepage
[1] 65001</code></pre>
<p>Both “codepage” and “system.codepage” must be 65001. When running RTerm (so also R.exe) from the command line, make sure to set up this code page and select a font with a wide set of glyphs. In cmd.exe, use <code>chcp 65001</code> and select e.g. <code>NSimFun</code> before running R.</p>
<p>R is patched to install binary packages built with UCRT. Most of CRAN and several of their BIOC dependencies are available at this point and some of them are patched. For example, try on <code>PKI</code>, which is patched.</p>
<h2 id="installation-of-external-software-for-building-from-source">Installation of external software for building from source</h2>
<p>To build R from source, one needs Msys2 (with packages <code>unzip diffutils make winpty rsync texinfo tar texinfo-tex zip subversion bison moreutils xz patch</code>), MikTeX (with basic packages and <code>inconsolata</code>), and Inno Setup. Inno Setup is only needed for building R, not R packages.</p>
<p>For automated installation (ideal for fresh Windows installs e.g. in a virtual machine or a container):</p>
<pre><code>cd \
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://svn.r-project.org/R-dev-web/trunk/WindowsBuilds/winutf8/ucrt3/r/setup.ps1 -OutFile setup.ps1 -UseBasicParsing
PowerShell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File setup.ps1</code></pre>
<p>Use that script with care on machines used also for anything else, e.g.  apply the needed steps manually. One may also want to clean up after the script (<code>temp</code> can be deleted).</p>
<h2 id="binary-installer-of-r-building-packages-from-source">Binary installer of R, building packages from source</h2>
<p>Install R from the binary installer and the external software as shown above.</p>
<p>Download and unpack the gcc10 toolchain and pre-built libraries, set environment variables, and then run R. The toolchain and libraries are available in a single tarball <a href="https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/winutf8/ucrt3/">here</a>, a file named such as <code>gcc10_ucrt3_4354.txz</code>.</p>
<p>Run an msys2 shell <code>C:\msys64\msys2.exe</code> and these commands:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir ucrt3
cd ucrt3
wget https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/winutf8/ucrt3/gcc10_ucrt3_4354.txz
tar xf gcc10_ucrt3_4354.txz

export PATH=/c/Program\ Files/MiKTeX/miktex/bin/x64:$PATH
export TAR=&quot;/usr/bin/tar --force-local&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Better check the paths are set properly by running</p>

/c/Program Files/MiKTeX/miktex/bin/x64/pdflatex</code></pre>
<p>Now run R from this terminal by <code>/c/Program\ Files/R/R-devel/bin/R</code>. Try installing “PKI”: <code>install.packages("PKI", type="source")</code>.</p>
<p>This will build from source <code>PKI</code> and its dependency <code>base64enc</code>. A patch for <code>PKI</code> to build with UCRT will be downloaded and applied automatically.</p>
<h2 id="building-r-from-source">Building R from source</h2>
<p>Do all the steps as above (yet there is no need to install binary version of R).</p>

<p>Prepare <code>MkRules.local</code>, download recommended packages, and build R:</p>

<p>Now one can run R via <code>../../bin/R</code>.</p>
<p>To build the installer, run <code>make distribution</code>, it will appear in <code>installer/R-devel-win.exe</code>. To build R with debug symbols, set <code>export DEBUG=T</code> in the terminal before the build (and possibly add `EOPTS = -O0" to MkRules.local.</p>
<h2 id="updating-r-packages">Updating R packages</h2>
<p>R packages with only R code should work without any modification. R packages with native code (C, Fortran, C++) but without any dependencies on external libraries, may work right away as well. Other packages will typically need some work.</p>
<h3 id="linking-to-pre-built-static-libraries">Linking to pre-built static libraries</h3>
<p>Some R packages tend to download external static libraries during their installation, from “winlibs” or other sources. Such libraries are, however, built against MSVCRT so they cannot work with UCRT. A common symptom is that one gets error messages about undefined references to <code>__imp___iob_func</code> or <code>__ms_vsnprintf</code> or <code>_setjmp</code>, but downloading of external code is usually obvious from <code>src/Makevars.win</code> or <code>configure.win</code>.</p>
<p>To fix this, one needs to instead build against libraries built for UCRT. A number of these libraries are available with the toolchain. For example, package <code>tiff</code> as of this writing has in <code>src/Makevars.win</code>:</p>
<pre><code>RWINLIB = ../windows/libtiff-4.1.0/mingw$(WIN)
PKG_CPPFLAGS = -I$(RWINLIB)/include
PKG_LIBS = -L$(RWINLIB)/lib -ltiff -ljpeg -lz

all: clean winlibs

winlibs:
        &quot;${R_HOME}/bin${R_ARCH_BIN}/Rscript.exe&quot; &quot;../tools/winlibs.R&quot;</code></pre>
<p>To make the package build with UCRT and the experimental toolchain, one can replace these lines by:</p>
<pre><code>PKG_LIBS = -ltiff -ljpeg -lz -lzstd -lwebp -llzma 
all: clean 
</code></pre>
<p>Note that even Rtools4 has these libraries, so one may and should reduce the use of downloading of external pre-built code also with the main package versions. Still, one cannot always use the same linking orders with different toolchains, because libraries may have different names and/or dependencies. See below for more details how to find the libraries to link and their order.</p>
<h3 id="creating-a-package-patch">Creating a package patch</h3>
<p>This experimental build of R automatically downloads and applies patches to packages from <a href="https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/winutf8/ucrt3/patches">here</a>, so <a href="https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/winutf8/ucrt3/patches/CRAN/tiff.diff">tiff.diff</a> is a patch for the tiff package discussed above.</p>
<p>To create such a patch, get and unpack the sources</p>
<pre><code>wget https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/tiff_0.1-6.tar.gz
mkdir original patched
cd original
tar xfz ../tiff_0.1-6.tar.gz
cd ../patched
tar xfz ../tiff_0.1-6.tar.gz</code></pre>
<p>If updating an existing patch, apply it first:</p>
<pre><code>cd patched
wget https://svn.r-project.org/R-dev-web/trunk/WindowsBuilds/winutf8/ucrt3/r_packages/patches/CRAN/tiff.diff
patch -p1 &lt;tiff.diff</code></pre>
<p>now edit <code>patched/tiff/src/Makevars.win</code> as shown above.</p>
<p>Test the package:</p>
<pre><code>R CMD build patched/tiff # possibly with --no-build-vignettes
R CMD INSTALL tiff_0.1-6.tar.gz
R CMD check tiff_0.1-6.tar.gz</code></pre>
<p>Note, “R CMD INSTALL” will still try applying an old patch if present. That would probably fail, so it does usually not matter. To disable this reliably, set environment variable <code>_R_INSTALL_TIME_PATCHES_</code> to e.g.  <code>/tmp</code> (a directory that does not have a patch index, more details later below).</p>
<p>And when done, create the patch using</p>
<pre><code>diff -Nru original/tiff patched/tiff &gt; tiff.diff</code></pre>
<p>One may instruct R to download patches, instead, from a local directory. To do so, download first the current patches from <a href="https://svn.r-project.org/R-dev-web/trunk/WindowsBuilds/winutf8/ucrt3/r_packages/patches/">here</a>, update them as needed, then run script <a href="https://svn.r-project.org/R-dev-web/trunk/WindowsBuilds/winutf8/ucrt3/r_packages/build_patches_idx.r">build_patches_idx.r</a> to build patch index <code>patches_idx.rds</code>, and then tell R via environment variable <code>_R_INSTALL_TIME_PATCHES_</code> about the directory where this index is.</p>
<p>Please contribute any new/updated well tested patches.</p>
<h3 id="multiple-definitions-of-symbols">Multiple definitions of symbols</h3>
<p>Another common issue observed with the new toolchain are linker errors about multiply defined symbols. This may be because GCC 10 is stricter about the use of tentative definitions (global variables defined without an initializer) than earlier versions, which allowed merging of tentative definitions by the linker by putting them into a single “common” block. With GCC 10, and earlier version with <code>-fno-common</code>, this merging does not happen and one instead gets the linker error. A quick hack is to build with <code>-fcommon</code> to still use the common block, and this is also a reliable way of detecting the cause of the problem. However, packages with these problem should be fixed in their main versions rather than by adding <code>-fcommon</code> via a patch for this toolchain (even those for which such toolchain-specific installation patch has already been created).</p>
<h3 id="other-issues">Other issues</h3>
<p>Other problems faced already included missing external libraries (MXE configurations need to be added, as described below), external libraries built in a way unexpected by the package or in an unexpected version, headers stored in different directories (note <code>LOCAL_SOFT</code> variable is set to the root of the toolchain, so <code>$(LOCAL_SOFT)/include</code> is added automatically and subdirectories may be added explicitly), explicit setting of Windows target version (<code>_WIN32_WINNT</code>). Posix thread-safe functions are only available when <code>_POSIX_THREAD_SAFE_FUNCTIONS</code> macro is defined.</p>
<h2 id="building-the-toolchain-and-libraries-from-source">Building the toolchain and libraries from source</h2>
<p>The toolchain and libraries are built using a modified version of <a href="https://mxe.cc/">MXE</a>, which is available <a href="https://svn.r-project.org/R-dev-web/trunk/WindowsBuilds/winutf8/ucrt3/toolchain_libs/mxe">here</a>. The build is run on a Linux machine, so it involves building a GCC10/MinGW-W64/UCRT cross-compilation toolchain, cross-compiling a large number of libraries needed by R and R packages, and then building also a native compiler toolchain so that R and R packages can be built natively on Windows.</p>
<p>Scripts for setting up the build in docker running Ubuntu 20.04 are available <a href="https://svn.r-project.org/R-dev-web/trunk/WindowsBuilds/winutf8/ucrt3/toolchain_libs/">here</a>. However, this is easy enough and convenient to run natively. On Ubuntu 20.04, following <a href="https://mxe.cc/#requirements-debian">MXE documentation</a>, install these packages:</p>
<pre><code>apt-get install -y \
    autoconf \
    automake \
    autopoint \
    bash \
    bison \
    bzip2 \
    flex \
    g++ \
    g++-multilib \
    gettext \
    git \
    gperf \
    intltool \
    libc6-dev-i386 \
    libgdk-pixbuf2.0-dev \
    libltdl-dev \
    libssl-dev \
    libtool-bin \
    libxml-parser-perl \
    lzip \
    make \
    openssl \
    p7zip-full \
    patch \
    perl \
    python \
    ruby \
    sed \
    unzip \
    wget \
    xz-utils</code></pre>
<p>And then also install these:</p>
<pre><code>apt-get install -y texinfo sqlite3</code></pre>
<p>Run <code>make</code> (or <code>make -j</code>) in <code>mxe</code>. The build takes about 2 hours on a recent server machine, so don’t expect that to be fast, but then building individual MXE packages (new, modified) is fast as the build is incremental using <code>make</code>.</p>
<p>The result will appear in <code>mxe/usr</code>, the native toolchain and libraries specifically in <code>mxe/usr/x86_64-w64-mingw32.static.posix</code>. The content of that directory is currently just packed into a tarball available as e.g. <code>gcc10_ucrt3_4354.txz</code> <a href="https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/winutf8/ucrt3/">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="addingupdating-mxe-package">Adding/updating MXE package</h2>
<p>Some R packages cannot be built or don’t work, because they depend on an external library not available in the experimental toolchain. To add such software, one needs to create an appropriate MXE package or update one. <a href="https://mxe.cc/">MXE</a> documentation has more details, but for example the package for the tiff library is named “tiff” and available <a href="https://github.com/mxe/mxe/blob/master/src/tiff.mk">here</a> and did not have to be customized for R:</p>

<p>One may add a new package to <code>src</code>, then build it using <code>make pkgname</code>, and when ready, add that to <code>settings.mk</code> to the <code>LOCAL_PKG_LIST</code> so that it is built automatically. One the needs to copy the updated <code>usr/86_64-w64-mingw32.static.posix</code> to the Windows machine and perform R package builds there.</p>
<p>Often one may take inspiration from somewhere else. First, many packages are already available in MXE; if they just work, they only need to be added to <code>settings.mk</code>. Still, a number of packages had to be adapted or upgraded to build with UCRT. Then, some packages may be available in a similar customized version of MXE used by Octave, <a href="https://wiki.octave.org/MXE">MXE-Octave</a>. Then some packages popular in R community not present in MXE may be available in <a href="https://github.com/msys2/MINGW-packages">Msys2</a> or in its customized version <a href="https://github.com/r-windows/rtools-packages">Rtools4</a>, yet those package configurations are in a different format. Linux distributions, e.g. Debian, then have much bigger selection of build configurations of packages.</p>
<p>Please contribute any new/updated well tested MXE packages. In the ideal case, such package configurations should be contributed directly to MXE, that makes merging upstream changes easier, is a forcing function to meet their coding style, and a good thing to do.</p>
<h2 id="establishing-the-linking-order-in-r-packages-via-pkg-config">Establishing the linking order in R packages via pkg-config</h2>
<p>The linking order can be obtained via <code>pkg-config</code>, which is only available on the cross-compilation host (Linux). One may run</p>
<pre><code>env PKG_CONFIG_PATH=usr/x86_64-w64-mingw32.static.posix/lib/pkgconfig ./usr/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/bin/pkgconf --static libtiff-4 --libs-only-l</code></pre>
<p>to get <code>-ltiff -lwebp -lzstd -llzma -ljpeg -lz</code>, a correct linking order which may be added to the package <code>src/Makevars.win</code> for package tiff. One still has to figure out that the pkg-config package name is <code>libtiff-4</code> (the MXE package is <code>tiff</code>).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, <code>pkg-config</code> does not always provide a working linking order. For example, for <code>opencv</code>, at the time of this writing,</p>
<pre><code>env PKG_CONFIG_PATH=usr/x86_64-w64-mingw32.static.posix/lib/pkgconfig ./usr/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/bin/pkgconf --static opencv4 --libs-only-l</code></pre>
<p>gives</p>

<p>which does not work. One has to add <code>-L$(LOCAL_SOFT)/lib/opencv4/3rdparty</code> so that <code>-llibopenjp2 -lquirc</code> are found (<code>LOCAL_SOFT</code> is set to the root of the compiled native toolchain). Still, this list of libraries is not complete, a number of dependencies are missing (<code>webp</code> is one of them).</p>
<h2 id="establishing-the-linking-order-via-topological-sort">Establishing the linking order via topological sort</h2>
<p>As of this writing, the more successful way of establishing linking orders was via computation over the compiled static libraries. For this, a little background follows, substantially simplified.</p>
<p>R on Windows uses static linking. Static libraries are just archives of object files, without any references to other static libraries they may need as dependencies. The linker keeps track of currently undefined symbols and goes through the list of libraries (so archives of object files) from left to right. If an object file from a library defines a symbol that the linker knows is undefined, the linker will add that object file to the binary. It will then add any additional object files from the same library which define any undefined symbols arising from the same library, but it will not add other object files from that library. This may result in that new symbols would become undefined after processing that library. These symbols have to be defined by some of the additional libraries in the list.</p>
<p>For this to work, one needs to make sure that anytime one library uses symbols from another, it is processed earlier by the linker. This is a problem when there is a loop of dependent libraries, however, one can usually resolve that by adding some libraries multiple times to the list. Note also, as explained before, whether there is a loop or not in practice depends on which symbols happened to be undefined (needed from the library) at that particular point, so sometimes this can be resolved by placing the library earlier or later in the list. The GNU linker also allows to specify linking groups, within which linking is repeated in the given order re-starting until all symbols are resolved (see <code>--start-group</code> and <code>--end-group</code>), with a price in performance. This feature has not been needed yet in the experimental toolchain.</p>
<p>Symbols exported from object files tend to be unique, and they mostly are in the experimental toolchain. It should therefore be possible to come up with a tool that could well advice on the list and order of libraries to link. Possibly with heuristics to resolve some edge cases.</p>
<p>Traditionally, this is done in Unix using <code>lorder</code> script and <code>tsort</code>. <code>lorder</code> generates a list of dependencies between static libraries, defensively assuming that all object files from those libraries are needed. <code>tsort</code> establishes a topological ordering on the result of <code>lorder</code>. One can just try to build an R package without linking any libraries, parse the output from the linker looking for undefined symbols, find static libraries providing such symbols, and establish the topological ordering. The resulting linking order can be then added to the <code>src/Makevars.win</code>, the build of the R package tried again, generating another list of undefined symbols. Then we can merge the list of libraries established previously with the list established now, do the topological sort again, and iterate this way until linking succeeds.</p>
<p>This is how linking orders for most patched CRAN packages were obtained, but thorough testing is needed to figure out whether they produce a working package. In principle, a better tool could definitely make this process faster (reduce the number of iterations, etc).</p>
<p>Some manual adaptations were needed, anyway, and probably always will. These included resolving loops (<code>tsort</code> gives warning when it sees them, which is a hint) by shifting libraries in the ordering and adding one twice. Also, some symbols are not unique and the semi-automated process did not choose the best library (e.g. <code>libmincore</code> and <code>libwindowsapp</code> should not be linked, because they depend on console Windows DLLs which are not present on Windows Server).</p>
<p>None of this should be needed if the <code>pkg-config</code> databases were fixed to work reliably with static linking.</p>
<p>That could be done via improving MXE package configurations. Even though MXE supports static linking, it may not have been tested as well as dynamic linking. Note that similar problems with other toolchains may be hidden when pre-built (bigger) static libraries are being downloaded during package installation.</p>
<h2 id="troubleshooting-library-loading-failures">Troubleshooting library loading failures</h2>
<p>Sometimes a package DLL is linked succesfully, but the DLL cannot be loaded. Sometimes it can be loaded on the machine where it was built, but not on another machine. One example is the linking of console API present on Windows 10, but not on Windows Server. A common problem why a DLL cannot be loaded is that a dependent DLL is not found (unlike static libraries, DLLs know their dependencies). This is a common problem which can happen on Windows with any toolchain.</p>
<p>When this happens to a DLL linked to an application, such as <code>Rblas</code> linked to <code>R</code>, an error message will appear helpfully saying that <code>Rblas</code> could not be found. However, when such DLL is being loaded explicitly via a Windows API call (to `LoadLibrary), which is the case when loading DLLs from R packages, Windows is unable to say which DLL is missing:</p>
<pre><code>Error: package or namespace load failed for &#39;magick&#39; in inDL(x, as.logical(local
), as.logical(now), ...):
 unable to load shared object &#39;C:/msys64/home/tomas/ucrt3/svn/ucrt3/r_packages/r
inst/library/00LOCK-magick/00new/magick/libs/x64/magick.dll&#39;:
  LoadLibrary failure:  The specified module could not be found.</code></pre>
<p>Note: in the above, <code>magick.dll</code> is present on the path listed. It is some of its dependencies that is not found. The confusing error message comes directly from Windows.</p>
<p>There is still a way to debug this. One can install <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/">WinDbg</a> from Microsoft (for free), which also includes <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/gflags">gflags</a>.</p>
<p>Using <code>gflags /i Rterm.exe +sls</code> (note <code>gflags</code> gets installed to <code>C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Debuggers\x64\</code>) set “loaded snaps” for the R executable. Then run R, get its process ID using <code>Sys.getpid()</code>, start <code>WinDbg</code>, attach to the R process via that process ID, type ‘g’ (to continue running). In the R process, try to load the problematic package, e.g. <code>library(magick)</code>. This will produce a number of messages, but in this case, one of them was</p>
