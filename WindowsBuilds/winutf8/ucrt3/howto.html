<h1 id="howto-utf-8-as-native-encoding-in-r-on-windows">Howto: UTF-8 as native encoding in R on Windows</h1>
<p>For UTF-8 as native encoding on Windows, we need a new compiler toolchain using UCRT as C runtime and we have to rebuild all native code with it: R, packages with native code and libraries used by those. Some of that code needs patching (for UCRT, for newer toolchain, newer libraries, etc).</p>
<p>We also need to adapt our code to work with multi-byte encodings where it may previously have expected single-byte or double-byte encodings. Sooner we find about these problems and fix them, sooner we can enjoy UTF-8 in R on Windows.</p>
<p>Regular CRAN checks (“additional checks” of kind “gcc10-UCRT”) are being run using the experimental toolchain described here.</p>
<p>This document describes how to obtain an experimental build of R for Windows with UTF-8 as the current native encoding, how to install packages, how to update packages to work with the toolchain, and additional advanced issues.</p>
<h2 id="installing-r-build-using-installer-binary-packages">Installing R build using installer, binary packages</h2>
<p>One needs recent Windows 10 (May 2019 Update or newer, which one should normally get simply by updating via Microsoft Update) or Windows Server 2022 for UTF-8 as the native encoding. Still, one may test the build and the toolchain on older versions of Windows where a different native encoding will be used, as in current MSVCRT builds of R.</p>
<p>Windows Server 2016 and all versions of Windows 10 already ship with UCRT. On earlier versions (from Windows Vista SP2, Sever 2008 SP1) UCRT can be <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/update-for-universal-c-runtime-in-windows-c0514201-7fe6-95a3-b0a5-287930f3560c">installed</a> manually.</p>
<p>Before installing this build of R, please remove any existing installation of R-devel and the package library of R-devel, because the packages are incompatible. If you want to go back to the standard MSVCRT build of R-devel, please again remove the library, first.</p>
<p>The binary installer of R is available <a href="https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/winutf8/ucrt3/">here</a> in a file named such as <code>R-devel-win-79604-4354-4361.exe</code> (the numbers differ, they encode the current version). Only 64-bit version is available and no 32-bit version is planned.</p>
<p>To check UTF-8 is used as native encoding, run</p>
<pre><code>&gt; l10n_info()
$MBCS
[1] TRUE

$`UTF-8`
[1] TRUE

$`Latin-1`
[1] FALSE

$codepage
[1] 65001

$system.codepage
[1] 65001</code></pre>
<p>Both “codepage” and “system.codepage” must be 65001. When running RTerm (so also R.exe) from the command line, make sure to set up this code page and select a font with a wide set of glyphs. In cmd.exe, use <code>chcp 65001</code> and select e.g. <code>NSimFun</code> before running R.</p>
<p>This build of R is patched to install binary packages built with UCRT (those that need compilation), but the other binary packages are currently taken from the CRAN package builds done using the MSVCRT build of R.</p>
<p>Some of these CRAN packages are patched at installation time to build/work with UCRT and this toolchain (more below). Bioconductor packages needed by CRAN packages are also available in binary form and some of them with installation-time patches.</p>
<p>For example, try installing <code>PKI</code>:</p>
<pre><code>install.packages(&quot;PKI&quot;, type=&quot;source&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>will install a binary build of the PKI package, which has been patched to work with this toolchain.</p>
<h2 id="installation-of-external-software-for-building-from-source">Installation of external software for building from source</h2>
<p>One needs MikTeX (with basic packages and <code>inconsolata</code>) to build package vignettes and documentation. Inno Setup is (only) needed for building R installer, not R packages. This is the same for all current versions of R and previous installations can be used.</p>
<p>In addition, one needs the compiler toolchain with pre-compiled libraries to build R and packages. This toolchain is available in two forms: RTools42 preview (works very similarly to Rtools4) and tarball for manual installation (more flexible, see below).</p>
<h2 id="installing-rtools42-preview">Installing RTools42 (preview)</h2>
<p>A preview version of RTools42 can be installed using an installer from <a href="https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/winutf8/ucrt3/">here</a>, a file named such as <code>rtools42-4737-4741.exe</code>, where <code>4737-4741</code> are version numbers and change as new builds are being added. The installer has currently about 700M in size and about 4.5G will be used after installation. It is bigger than RTools4, because it includes libraries needed by almost all CRAN packages, so that such libraries don’t have to be downloaded from external sources. The advantage is that this way it is easy to ensure that the toolchain and the libraries are always compatible, and to upgrade the toolchain and all libraries together: this had to be done for rebuilding the libraries all with UCRT, but incompatibilities do arise even with small updates to the toolchain, particularly libraries using C++.</p>
<p>It is recommended to use the defaults and install into <code>c:/rtools42</code>.</p>
<p>RTools42 include build tools from Msys2 (like RTools4, but in original Msys2 versions) and the compiler toolchain and libraries built using MXE (unlike RTools4, which builds them using Msys2). From the user perspective, it works the same as RTools4 and the installer is almost the same.</p>
<h2 id="building-packages-from-source-using-rtools42">Building packages from source using RTools42</h2>
<p>One only needs to install the R build and RTools42 as shown above, in either order. No further set up is needed, not even PATH changes by default – one may run R e.g. using the desktop icon (Rgui) and then invoke (but, in short, this works from user perspective the same as with RTools4 and the MSVCRT builds of R):</p>
<pre><code>install.packages(&quot;PKI&quot;, type=&quot;source&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>which will build from source <code>PKI</code> and its dependency <code>base64enc</code>. A patch for <code>PKI</code> to build with UCRT will be downloaded and applied automatically.</p>
<p>As a harder and longer test, let’s try installing <code>RcppCWB</code> from github.</p>
<p>First, install <code>devtools</code> (accept to build packages from source when offered, but most needed packages will be installed as binary):</p>
<pre><code>install.packages(devtools)</code></pre>
<p>And then install <code>RcppCWB</code> from github from source:</p>
<pre><code>devtools::install_github(&quot;PolMine/RcppCWB&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>The installation will by default use an installation-time patch for RcppCWB (that is based on package name, so also used for installs not from CRAN).</p>
<p>Currently, RcppCWB supports UCRT via this patch by building the CWB source code during R package installation, like e.g. on Unix, so this takes several minutes.</p>
<p>Finally, let’s check package <code>tiff</code>:</p>
<pre><code>download.packages(&quot;tiff&quot;, destdir=&quot;.&quot;)
tools::Rcmd(&quot;check tiff_0.1-8.tar.gz&quot;) # update file name as needed</code></pre>
<p>One can run the package check also from command-line, e.g. cmd.exe, as usual.</p>
<h2 id="building-r-from-source-using-rtools42">Building R from source using RTools42</h2>
<p>As with Rtools4, one may run the Msys2 shell (“Rtools bash” from the startup menu, or <code>c:/rtools42/msys2.exe</code> and run R from there). One may also install additional Msys2 software using <code>pacman</code>, e.g. additional build tools.</p>
<p>Run the Msys2 shell, update the Msys2 part and install two more package:</p>
<pre><code>pacman -Syuu
pacman -Sy wget subversion</code></pre>
<p>As an aside, these pacman commands may be useful. Install an index of available files using <code>pacman -Fy</code> and then get e.g. a package providing file <code>unzip.exe</code> by <code>pacman -F unzip.exe</code>. List all available packages (not necessarily installed) using <code>pacman -Sl</code>. List installed packages using <code>pacman -Q</code>. One should only be installing packages from “msys” sub-repository of Msys2, mixing other sub-repositories with the toolchain may cause trouble.</p>
<p>Download and unpack Tcl/Tk bundle from <a href="https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/winutf8/ucrt3/">here</a>, a file currently named <code>Tcl.zip</code>. Download R sources. Download and apply patches for R (please note that the numbers 80912 and 4742 need to be replaced by the current ones, there is always only one version available at the time; see the <a href="https://svn.r-project.org/R-dev-web/trunk/WindowsBuilds/winutf8/ucrt3/r_packages/README_checks">README</a> for more information about versioning)</p>

cd src/gnuwin32</code></pre>
<p>To automatically download always the current/latest version of the diff, one can do e.g. this:</p>
<pre><code>wget -np -nd -r -l1 -A &#39;R-devel-*.diff&#39; https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/winutf8/ucrt3</code></pre>
<p>Set environment variables as follows (update MiKTeX installation directory if needed, this one is “non-standard” from an automated installation described later below):</p>
<pre><code>export PATH=/c/rtools42/x86_64-w64-mingw32.static.posix/bin:/c/rtools42/usr/bin:$PATH
export PATH=/c/Program\ Files/MiKTeX/miktex/bin/x64:$PATH
export TAR=&quot;/usr/bin/tar&quot;
export TAR_OPTIONS=&quot;--force-local&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Test that the tools are available by running</p>
<pre><code>which make gcc pdflatex tar</code></pre>
<p>Note: the issue with <code>tar</code> is that GNU tar does not work with colons used in drive letters on Windows paths, because it instead uses colons when specifying non-local archives. By adding <code>--force-local</code> to <code>TAR_OPTIONS</code>, this is disabled and colons work for drive letters. One can, instead, use the Windows tar (a variant of BSD tar), e.g. <code>/c/Windows/System32/tar</code>, but some packages rely on GNU tar features. RTools4 and earlier used a customized version of GNU tar, which did not need the <code>--force-local</code> options for drive letters to work.</p>
<p><code>MkRules.rules</code> expects Inno Setup in <code>C:/Program Files (x86)/Inno Setup 6</code>. If you have installed it into a different directory, specify it in <code>MkRules.local</code>:</p>
<pre><code>cat &lt;&lt;EOF &gt;MkRules.local
ISDIR = C:/Program Files (x86)/InnoSetup
EOF</code></pre>
<p>Build R and recommended packages:</p>
<pre><code>make rsync-recommended
make all recommended</code></pre>
<p>When the build succeeds, one can run R via <code>../../bin/R</code>.</p>
<p>To build the installer, run <code>make distribution</code>, it will appear in <code>installer/R-devel-win.exe</code>.</p>
<p>To build R with debug symbols, set <code>export DEBUG=T</code> in the terminal before the build (and possibly add `EOPTS = -O0" to MkRules.local to disable compiler optimizations, hence obtaining reliable debug information).</p>
<h2 id="installing-external-tools-and-the-toolchain-without-rtools42">Installing external tools and the toolchain without RTools42</h2>
<p>One may install the toolchain also without RTools42. This is more flexible in that one may install smaller amount of code, particularly when automating the builds on pre-installed virtual machines, such as when running github actions.</p>
<p>To build R from source, one needs some build tools such as <code>make</code>. This text assumes that one uses a standalone installation of Msys2 (with packages <code>unzip diffutils make winpty rsync texinfo tar texinfo-tex zip subversion bison moreutils xz patch</code>), but different implementations may be used.</p>
<p>The script below automatically installs Msys2, MiKTeX and Inno Setup (the last two into non-standard directories) and can be used on fresh systems or virtual machines or containers without previous installation of this software. It could also be used as an inspiration for installing on real systems, but one should review it first or run selected lines manually, to prevent damage to the existing installations:</p>
<pre><code>cd \
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://svn.r-project.org/R-dev-web/trunk/WindowsBuilds/winutf8/ucrt3/r/setup.ps1 -OutFile setup.ps1 -UseBasicParsing
PowerShell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File setup.ps1</code></pre>
<p>One may also want to clean up after the script (<code>temp</code> can be deleted).</p>
<h2 id="binary-installer-of-r-building-packages-from-source-without-rtools42">Binary installer of R, building packages from source (without RTools42)</h2>
<p>First, download the toolchain and libraries. They are available in a single tarball <a href="https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/winutf8/ucrt3/">here</a>, a file named such as <code>gcc10_ucrt3_full_4737.tar.zst</code>.</p>
<p>There is also a variant named <code>gcc10_ucrt3_base_4737.tar.zst</code>, which is smaller, only has enough libraries to install base R and recommended packages (which are probably enough also for many, but not all, CRAN packages). The Zstandard compressor works better on these files than the compressor used by RTools42 (Inno Setup does not support Zstandard compression), so the file is smaller and decompresses faster.</p>
<p>You may run an MSys2 shell <code>C:\msys64\msys2.exe</code> and the following commands (please note the number 4737 in this example needs to be replaced by the current release available, there is always only one at a time):</p>
<pre><code>mkdir ucrt3
cd ucrt3
wget https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/winutf8/ucrt3/gcc10_ucrt3_full_4737.tar.zst
tar xf gcc10_ucrt3_full_4737.tar.zst

export PATH=`pwd`/x86_64-w64-mingw32.static.posix/bin:$PATH
export PATH=/c/Program\ Files/MiKTeX/miktex/bin/x64:$PATH
export TAR=&quot;/usr/bin/tar --force-local&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Better check the paths are set properly by running</p>
<pre><code>which gcc pdflatex tar</code></pre>
<p>which should find the tools.</p>
<p>Now run R from the same terminal by <code>/c/Program\ Files/R/R-devel/bin/R</code>. Try installing “PKI”: <code>install.packages("PKI", type="source")</code>.</p>
<p>This will build from source <code>PKI</code> and its dependency <code>base64enc</code>. A patch for <code>PKI</code> to build with UCRT will be downloaded and applied automatically.</p>
<p>Examples in this documents use Msys2 with mintty and bash, which is the default with Msys2 and is perhaps easier to use with building/testing for those familiar with Unix. One can, however, also use cmd.exe, with the benefit of nicer fonts and more reliable line editing (mintty uses a different interface to communicate with RTerm).</p>
<h2 id="building-r-from-source-without-rtools42">Building R from source (without RTools42)</h2>
<p>Download and unpack Tcl/Tk bundle from <a href="https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/winutf8/ucrt3/">here</a>, a file currently named <code>Tcl.zip</code>. Download R sources. Download and apply patches for R. Do this in the msys2 shell with the settings from above (please note that the numbers 80890 and 4736 need to be replaced by the current ones)</p>
<pre><code>wget https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/winutf8/ucrt3/Tcl.zip

svn checkout -r 80890 https://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk

cd trunk
patch --binary -p0 &lt; ../R-devel-80890-4736.diff

unzip ../Tcl.zip

cd src/gnuwin32</code></pre>
<p>Test that the tools are available by running (set variables like for building R packages, as shown above):</p>
<pre><code>which make gcc pdflatex tar</code></pre>
<p><code>MkRules.rules</code> expects Inno Setup in <code>C:/Program Files (x86)/Inno Setup 6</code>. If you have installed it into a different directory (such as by the automated script above), specify it in <code>MkRules.local</code>:</p>
<pre><code>cat &lt;&lt;EOF &gt;MkRules.local
ISDIR = C:/Program Files (x86)/InnoSetup
EOF</code></pre>
<p>Build R and recommended packages:</p>
<pre><code>make rsync-recommended
make all recommended</code></pre>
<p>When the build succeeds, one can run R via <code>../../bin/R</code>.</p>
<p>To build the installer, run <code>make distribution</code>, it will appear in <code>installer/R-devel-win.exe</code>.</p>
<p>To make the use of RTools42 simpler, when R is installed via the binary installer, it by default uses RTools42 for the compilers and libraries. <code>PATH</code> will be set by R (inside frontends like RGui and RTerm, but also R CMD) to include the build tools (e.g. make) and the compilers (e.g. gcc). This can be overridden by setting environment variable <code>R_CUSTOM_TOOLS_PATH</code>. Also, R installed via the binary installer will automatically set <code>R_TOOLS_SOFT</code> (and <code>LOCAL_SOFT</code> for backwards compatibility) to RTools42 for building R packages. This can be overriden by setting environment variable <code>R_CUSTOM_TOOLS_SOFT</code>. Please note that the defaults apply even when RTools42 is not installed, then using the default installation location.</p>
<p>Hence, to use R installed via the binary installer to build R packages using the toolchain extracted from the tarball as shown here, one would set</p>
<pre><code>export R_CUSTOM_TOOLS_SOFT=`pwd`/x86_64-w64-mingw32.static.posix
export R_CUSTOM_TOOLS_PATH=$R_CUSTOM_TOOLS_SOFT/bin</code></pre>
<p>This is not needed when installing R from source and building R packages using that installation. In such case, the build tools and compilers already have to be on PATH, and R uses by default <code>R_TOOLS_SOFT</code> (and <code>LOCAL_SOFT</code>) derived from that. See below in this text for discussion re <code>LOCAL_SOFT</code>.</p>
<p>To build R with debug symbols, set <code>export DEBUG=T</code> in the terminal before the build (and possibly add `EOPTS = -O0" to MkRules.local to disable compiler optimizations, hence obtaining reliable debug information).</p>
<h2 id="testing-packages-using-github-actions">Testing packages using github actions</h2>
<p>Github default runners for github actions include Windows Server 2022, which has support for UTF-8 as native encoding and has pre-installed build tools. It is thus convenient to only install the toolchain there, packaged using Zstandard compression (smaller, faster to decompress).</p>
<p>For packages that only need libraries from the “base” toolchain, it is better to use that, saving more time and bandwidth. The actions should download the toolchain from github, not from CRAN servers.</p>
<p>R itself can be installed from the binary installer and cached. Caching the toolchain itself is not helpful: the default compression currently used for that is much less efficient than Zstandard, so using the cache checking takes longer and requires more resources.</p>
<p>An experiment has been carried out using <code>codetools</code> (a package without dependencies and not needing compilation) and using <code>tiff</code> (a package needed compilation and depending on two more packages).</p>
<p>With <code>tiff</code>, checking with a missing toolchain (which fails) took over 2 minutes. Checking with the base toolchain took about 15 more seconds (and passed, it is enough for the involved packages). Checking with the full toolchain tool 5 minutes. More information is available <a href="https://github.com/kalibera/ucrt3">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="updating-r-packages-to-work-with-the-ucrt-toolchain">Updating R packages to work with the UCRT toolchain</h2>
<p>R packages with only R code should work without any modification. R packages with native code (C, Fortran, C++) but without any dependencies on external libraries may work right away as well. Other packages will typically need some work.</p>
<h3 id="linking-to-pre-built-static-libraries">Linking to pre-built static libraries</h3>
<p>Some R packages tend to download external static libraries during their installation from “winlibs” or other sources. Such libraries are, however, as of this writing built against MSVCRT and hence cannot work with UCRT.</p>
<p>A common symptom is that one gets error messages about undefined references also to <code>__imp___iob_func</code>, <code>__ms_vsnprintf</code> or <code>_setjmp</code>, but downloading of external code is usually obvious from <code>src/Makevars.win</code> (e.g. presence of “winlibs” or from <code>configure.win</code>).</p>
<p>To fix this, one needs to instead build against libraries built for UCRT. While libraries built for UCRT may become available for download, it is not a good idea downloading them during package installation.</p>
<p>For transparency, source packages should contain source (not executable code). Using pre-compiled binaries often leads to that after few years, the information on how they were built gets lost. Using older binary code may also provide insufficient performance (newer compilers tend to optimize better). Also, the CRAN (and Bioconductor) repositories are used as a unique test suite for R itself but also the toolchain, and by re-using pre-compiled libraries, some parts will not be tested. Finally, object files (and hence static libraries, particularly when using C++) on Windows tend to become incompatible when even the same toolchain is upgraded. Going from MSVCRT to UCRT is an extreme case when all such code becomes incompatible, and adding support to 64-bit ARM would be another extreme case, but smaller updates of different parts of the toolchain or even some libraries in it have lead to incompatibilities as well.</p>
<p>As an example of the necessary updates, package <code>tiff</code> as of this writing has in <code>src/Makevars.win</code>:</p>
<pre><code>RWINLIB = ../windows/libtiff-4.1.0/mingw$(WIN)
PKG_CPPFLAGS = -I$(RWINLIB)/include
PKG_LIBS = -L$(RWINLIB)/lib -ltiff -ljpeg -lz

all: clean winlibs

winlibs:
        &quot;${R_HOME}/bin${R_ARCH_BIN}/Rscript.exe&quot; &quot;../tools/winlibs.R&quot;</code></pre>
<p>To make the package build with UCRT and the experimental toolchain, one can replace these lines by:</p>
<pre><code>PKG_LIBS = -ltiff -ljpeg -lz -lzstd -lwebp -llzma 
all: clean 
</code></pre>
<p>Note that even Rtools4 has these libraries, so one could make a similar change also for building the package with Rtools4 (even for MSVCRT, so avoid downloading pre-compiled libraries). However, the same set and ordering of libraries may not work with RTools4, because the names would sometimes be different.</p>
<h3 id="creating-a-package-patch">Creating a package patch</h3>
<p>This experimental build of R automatically downloads and applies patches to packages from <a href="https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/winutf8/ucrt3/patches">here</a>, so <a href="https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/winutf8/ucrt3/patches/CRAN/tiff.diff">tiff.diff</a> is a patch for the tiff package discussed above.</p>
<p>These patches have been created for most CRAN packages and several Bioconductor packages (so that all Bioconductor packages needed for CRAN packages are built), so package authors can currently just take them, review them, and incorporate in their packages, but eventually such changes have to be maintained in the packages.</p>
<p>To create such a patch, get and unpack the sources</p>
<pre><code>wget https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/tiff_0.1-6.tar.gz
mkdir original patched
cd original
tar xfz ../tiff_0.1-6.tar.gz
cd ../patched
tar xfz ../tiff_0.1-6.tar.gz</code></pre>
<p>If updating an existing patch, apply it first:</p>
<pre><code>cd patched
wget https://svn.r-project.org/R-dev-web/trunk/WindowsBuilds/winutf8/ucrt3/r_packages/patches/CRAN/tiff.diff
patch -p1 &lt;tiff.diff</code></pre>
<p>now you may edit any source file in the package, e.g.  <code>patched/tiff/src/Makevars.win</code> as shown above. However, specifically for the case of <code>Makevars</code> (and <code>Makefile</code>) files, it is preferred to created a copy with <code>.ucrt</code> extensions instead of <code>.win</code>. <code>Makevars.ucrt</code> (<code>Makefile.ucrt</code>) will take precedence over <code>Makevars.win</code> (<code>Makefile.win</code>) in this experimental build of R. Similarly, <code>configure.ucrt</code> and <code>cleanup.ucrt</code> take precedence over <code>configure.win</code> and <code>cleanup.win</code>.</p>
<p>Test the package:</p>
<pre><code>env _R_INSTALL_TIME_PATCHES_=no R CMD build patched/tiff # possibly with --no-build-vignettes
env _R_INSTALL_TIME_PATCHES_=no R CMD INSTALL tiff_0.1-6.tar.gz
env _R_INSTALL_TIME_PATCHES_=no R CMD check tiff_0.1-6.tar.gz</code></pre>
<p>The setting of <code>_R_INSTALL_TIME_PATCHES_=no</code> above ensures that R will not attempt to patch automatically the package using a possibly present earlier patch, but will build/install/check exactly the tarball given.</p>
<p>And when done with testing, create the patch using</p>
<pre><code>diff -Nru original/tiff patched/tiff &gt; tiff.diff</code></pre>
<p>Note the ‘N’ which ensures new files (e.g. <code>Makevars.ucrt</code>) are added to the patch.</p>
<p>One may instruct R to download patches, instead, from a local directory. To do so, download first the current patches from <a href="https://svn.r-project.org/R-dev-web/trunk/WindowsBuilds/winutf8/ucrt3/r_packages/patches/">here</a>, update them as needed, then run script <a href="https://svn.r-project.org/R-dev-web/trunk/WindowsBuilds/winutf8/ucrt3/r_packages/build_patches_idx.r">build_patches_idx.r</a> to build patch index <code>patches_idx.rds</code>, and then tell R via environment variable <code>_R_INSTALL_TIME_PATCHES_</code> about the directory where this index is.</p>
<p>This automated installation-time patching is only intended as convenience for testing with this experimental toolchain and is likely to be removed in the future; it is not intended for an R release.</p>
<p>Therefore, if you are a package maintainer and want your package to work with UCRT, please update your source code accordingly, e.g. via adding <code>Makevars.ucrt</code> files. Feel free to re-use/copy from the patches provided for your packages, and feel free then to ask for the patches to be removed from the central repository.</p>
<p>If you are maintaining a package not on CRAN, but need to patch it to use a specific library from the toolchain, which is used by some CRAN package, it might be useful starting from the linking orders of that package (or a patch available for that package), rather than from scratch.</p>
<h3 id="multiple-definitions-of-symbols">Multiple definitions of symbols</h3>
<p>Another common issue observed with the new toolchain are linker errors about multiply defined symbols. This may be because GCC 10 is stricter about the use of tentative definitions (global variables defined without an initializer) than earlier versions, which allowed merging of tentative definitions by the linker by putting them into a single “common” block.</p>
<p>With GCC 10, and earlier version with <code>-fno-common</code>, this merging does not happen and one instead gets the linker error. A quick hack is to build with <code>-fcommon</code> to still use the common block, and this is also a reliable way of detecting the cause of the problem. See <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html#Common-symbols">Writing R Extension</a> for more details.</p>
<p>The patches provided for affected packages for now mostly use <code>-fcommon</code> in such cases, but this is a hack. Package maintainers who want their packages to work with UCRT (and GCC 10 and newer in principle) should instead fix the source code of their packages and then ask for the patch to be removed from the central repository.</p>
<h3 id="other-issues">Other issues</h3>
<p>Other problems faced already included missing external libraries (MXE configurations need to be added, as described below), external libraries built in a way unexpected by the package or in an unexpected version (e.g.  HDF5), headers stored in different directories (note <code>R_TOOLS_SOFT</code> variable is set to the root of the toolchain, so <code>$(R_TOOLS_SOFT)/include</code> is added automatically and subdirectories may be added explicitly), explicit setting of Windows target version (<code>_WIN32_WINNT</code>). Posix thread-safe functions are only available when <code>_POSIX_THREAD_SAFE_FUNCTIONS</code> macro is defined.</p>
<h2 id="building-the-toolchain-and-libraries-from-source">Building the toolchain and libraries from source</h2>
<p>The toolchain and libraries are built using a modified version of <a href="https://mxe.cc/">MXE</a>, which is available <a href="https://svn.r-project.org/R-dev-web/trunk/WindowsBuilds/winutf8/ucrt3/toolchain_libs/mxe">here</a>. The build is run on a Linux machine, so it involves building a GCC10/MinGW-W64/UCRT cross-compilation toolchain, cross-compiling a large number of libraries needed by R and R packages, and then building also a native compiler toolchain so that R and R packages can be built natively on Windows.</p>
<p>Scripts for setting up the build in docker running Ubuntu, Debian or Fedora are available <a href="https://svn.r-project.org/R-dev-web/trunk/WindowsBuilds/winutf8/ucrt3/toolchain_libs/">here</a>. However, this is easy enough and convenient to run natively. On Ubuntu 20.04, following <a href="https://mxe.cc/#requirements-debian">MXE documentation</a>, install these packages:</p>
<pre><code>apt-get install -y \
    autoconf \
    automake \
    autopoint \
    bash \
    bison \
    bzip2 \
    flex \
    g++ \
    g++-multilib \
    gettext \
    git \
    gperf \
    intltool \
    libc6-dev-i386 \
    libgdk-pixbuf2.0-dev \
    libltdl-dev \
    libssl-dev \
    libtool-bin \
    libxml-parser-perl \
    lzip \
    make \
    openssl \
    p7zip-full \
    patch \
    perl \
    python \
    ruby \
    sed \
    unzip \
    wget \
    xz-utils</code></pre>
<p>And then also install these:</p>
<pre><code>apt-get install -y texinfo sqlite3 zstd</code></pre>
<p>For Fedora distributions, see the script <code>build_in_docker.sh</code> for the required dependencies.</p>
<p>Run <code>make</code> (or <code>make -j</code>) in <code>mxe</code>. The build takes about 2 hours on a server machine with 20 cores, so don’t expect that to be fast, but then building individual MXE packages (new, modified) is fast as the build is incremental using <code>make</code>. It has been reported that 8G of RAM and two cores is enough for the build.</p>
<p>The result will appear in <code>mxe/usr</code>, the native toolchain and libraries specifically in <code>mxe/usr/x86_64-w64-mingw32.static.posix</code>. The content of that directory is currently just packed into a tarball available as e.g. <code>gcc10_ucrt3_full_4354.tar.zst</code> <a href="https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/winutf8/ucrt3/">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="addingupdating-mxe-package">Adding/updating MXE package</h2>
<p>Some R packages cannot be built or don’t work, because they depend on an external library not available in the experimental toolchain. To add such software, one needs to create an appropriate MXE package or update one. <a href="https://mxe.cc/">MXE</a> documentation has more details, but for example the package for the tiff library is named “tiff” and available <a href="https://github.com/mxe/mxe/blob/master/src/tiff.mk">here</a> and did not have to be customized for R:</p>

<p>One may add a new package to <code>src</code>, then build it using <code>make pkgname</code>, and when ready, add that to <code>settings.mk</code> to the <code>LOCAL_PKG_LIST</code> so that it is built automatically. One the needs to copy the updated <code>usr/86_64-w64-mingw32.static.posix</code> to the Windows machine and perform R package builds there.</p>
<p>When maintaining open-source software distributions, often one may take inspiration from somewhere else. First, many packages are already available in MXE; if they just work, they only need to be added to <code>settings.mk</code>. Still, a number of packages had to be adapted or upgraded to build with UCRT. Then, some packages may be available in a similar customized version of MXE used by Octave, <a href="https://wiki.octave.org/MXE">MXE-Octave</a>. Then some packages popular in the R community but not present in MXE may be available in <a href="https://github.com/msys2/MINGW-packages">Msys2</a> or <a href="https://github.com/r-windows/rtools-packages">Rtools4</a>, yet those package configurations are in a different format and not written for cross-compilation nor static linking. Linux distributions, e.g. Debian, then have much bigger selection of build configurations of packages, again in a different format.</p>
<p>If your package needs a library not currently supported by the modified version of MXE used to build in this toolchain, you are welcome to provide a build configuration for such library. In the ideal case, such package configurations would be contributed directly to upstream MXE, which may be a forcing function to test such package with more configurations (e.g. also dynamic linking, also MSVCRT, etc), but a much wider group of users will be able to benefit from that.</p>
<h2 id="establishing-the-linking-order-from-existing-patches">Establishing the linking order from existing patches</h2>
<p>As noted above, most CRAN packages that needed it at the time of this writing have been patched (the patch adding <code>Makevars.ucrt</code>), so package maintainer may find linking orders there and test them, update and add to their source code (possibly also checking against <code>pkg-config</code>, see below). It may be that some of them are incorrect, even though there are no linking errors - package authors may know better knowing their code, and issues should be discovered by testing.</p>
<h2 id="establishing-the-linking-order-in-r-packages-via-pkg-config">Establishing the linking order in R packages via pkg-config</h2>
<p>The linking order can be obtained via <code>pkg-config</code>, which is only available on the cross-compilation host (Linux). One may run</p>
<pre><code>env PKG_CONFIG_PATH=usr/x86_64-w64-mingw32.static.posix/lib/pkgconfig ./usr/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/bin/pkgconf --static libtiff-4 --libs-only-l</code></pre>
<p>to get <code>-ltiff -lwebp -lzstd -llzma -ljpeg -lz</code>, a correct linking order which may be added to the package <code>src/Makevars.ucrt</code> (<code>src/Makevars.win</code>) for package tiff. One still has to figure out that the pkg-config package name is <code>libtiff-4</code> (the MXE package is <code>tiff</code>, the Rtool4 package is <code>libtiff</code>).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, <code>pkg-config</code> does not always provide a working linking order. For example, for <code>opencv</code>, at the time of this writing (running on Linux),</p>
<pre><code>env PKG_CONFIG_PATH=usr/x86_64-w64-mingw32.static.posix/lib/pkgconfig ./usr/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/bin/pkgconf --static opencv4 --libs-only-l</code></pre>
<p>gives</p>
<pre><code>-lopencv_highgui451 -lopencv_ml451 -lopencv_objdetect451 -lopencv_photo451 -lopencv_stitching451 -lopencv_video451 -lopencv_calib3d451 -lopencv_features2d451 -lopencv_dnn451 -lopencv_flann451 -lopencv_videoio451 -lopencv_imgcodecs451 -lopencv_imgproc451 -lopencv_core451 -llibopenjp2 -lquirc -lprotobuf -lcomctl32 -lgdi32 -lole32 -lsetupapi -lws2_32 -ljpeg -lwebp -lpng -lz -ltiff -lzstd -llzma -lopengl32 -lglu32</code></pre>
<p>which does not work. One has to add <code>-L$(R_TOOLS_SOFT)/lib/opencv4/3rdparty</code> so that <code>-llibopenjp2 -lquirc</code> are found. <code>R_TOOLS_SOFT</code> is set to the root of the compiled native toolchain, <code>R_TOOLS_SOFT</code>/include is automatically available for headers, <code>R_TOOLS_SOFT</code>/lib is automatically available for libraries, but when one needs to refer to files in different locations or for different tools, one may have to use that variable.</p>
<p>There is also <code>LOCAL_SOFT</code> variable which by default points to the root of the compiled toolchain and in some CRAN packages has been used for this purpose (well before this toolchain existed). However, the original idea of <code>LOCAL_SOFT</code> was to use it for libraries not available with the toolchain, like <code>/usr/local</code> is used on Unix machines to refer to software not part of the OS distribution. It is hence more portable to use <code>R_TOOLS_SOFT</code> for the purpose of referring to the libraries/headers which are part of the toolchain.</p>
<p>Going back to the list of libraries obtained by pkg-config for opencv, this list is not complete, a number of dependencies are missing (<code>webp</code> is one of them). In principle, this is a common problem that <code>pkg-config</code> configurations are not thoroughly tested with static linking.</p>
<p>Packages hence should not use <code>pkg-config</code> directly in their make files, but in some cases, it may be give a hint/starting point when establisthing the linking order. In Rtools42 (so running on Windows), one may install <code>pkg-config</code> and get the libraries for <code>opencv</code> as follows:</p>
<pre><code>pacman -Sy pkg-config
env PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/x86_64-w64-mingw32.static.posix/lib/pkgconfig pkg-config --static opencv4 --libs-only-l</code></pre>
<h2 id="findlinkingorder-tool-for-establishing-the-linking-order-via-topological-sort">findLinkingOrder: tool for establishing the linking order via topological sort</h2>
<p>As of this writing, the more successful way of establishing linking orders was via computation over the compiled static libraries.</p>
<h3 id="background">Background</h3>
<p>This section may be skipped by those looking only for instructions to follow.</p>
<p>R on Windows uses static linking. Static libraries are just archives of object files, without any references to other static libraries they may need as dependencies. The linker keeps track of the currently undefined symbols and goes through the list of libraries (so archives of object files) from left to right. If an object file from a library defines a symbol that the linker knows is undefined, the linker will add that object file to the binary. It will then add any additional object files from the same library which define any undefined symbols arising from the same library, but it will not add other object files from that library. This may result in that new symbols would become undefined after processing that library. These symbols have to be defined by some of the additional libraries in the list.</p>
<p>For this to work, one needs to make sure that any time one library uses a symbol from another library, it is processed earlier by the linker. This is a problem when there is a loop of dependent libraries, however, one can usually resolve that by adding some libraries multiple times to the list or moving some library in the list, taking advantage of the mechanism described above: only the object files with some currently needed symbols are added from the library.</p>
<p>The GNU linker also allows to specify linking groups, within which linking is repeated in the given order re-starting until all symbols are resolved (see <code>--start-group</code> and <code>--end-group</code>), with a price in performance. This feature has not been needed yet in the experimental toolchain.</p>
<p>Symbols exported from object files and actually missing at linking time are mostly unique in the experimental toolchain. Non-unique are some inlined C++ functions (but then they are not missing at linking time), alternative implementations (e.g. parallel OpenBLAS, serial OpenBLAS, reference BLAS), runtime library wrappers (but they are not missing at linking time). As these exceptions are rare, it was possible to come up with a simple tool which can reasonably well advice on the list and order of libraries to link, with heuristics to resolve some edge cases.</p>
<p>Traditionally, this is done in Unix using <code>lorder</code> script and <code>tsort</code>. <code>lorder</code> generates a list of dependencies between static libraries, defensively assuming that all object files from those libraries are needed. <code>tsort</code> establishes a topological ordering on the result of <code>lorder</code>. One can just try to build an R package without linking any libraries, parse the output from the linker looking for undefined symbols, find static libraries providing such symbols, and establish the topological ordering. The resulting linking order can be then added to the <code>src/Makevars.ucrt</code> (<code>src/Makevars.win</code>), the build of the R package tried again, generating another list of undefined symbols. Then one can merge the list of libraries established previously with the list established now, do the topological sort again, and iterate this way until linking succeeds. <code>findLinkingOrder</code> does this, with some additional heuristics, as shown below.</p>
<p>This is how linking orders for most patched CRAN packages were obtained, but thorough testing is needed to figure out whether they produce a working package. In principle, a better tool could definitely make this process faster and more automated, and not requiring manual iterative linking attempts.</p>
<p>Some manual adaptations to the linking orders created that way were needed, anyway, and probably always will. These included resolving loops (<code>tsort</code> gives warning when it sees them, which is a hint) by shifting libraries in the ordering and adding some twice. Also, some symbols are not completely unique in the toolchain and the semi-automated process did not choose the best library (e.g. <code>libmincore</code> and <code>libwindowsapp</code> should not be linked, because they depend on console Windows DLLs which are not present on Windows Server). <code>-lsbml-static</code> should be used instead of <code>-lsbml.dll</code> (the latter is an import library for a DLL, not a static library with the code per se).</p>
<p>None of this should be needed if the <code>pkg-config</code> databases were fixed to work reliably with static linking. That could be done via improving MXE package configurations, but the effort required may be bigger than improving a hint tool described above, but if fixed, the results could be more reliable. One still would need to know the right names of the pkg-config packages, which are distribution specific.</p>
<p>Note that similar problems with other toolchains may be hidden when pre-built (bigger) static libraries are being downloaded during package installation.</p>
<h3 id="using-findlinkingorder-with-rtools42-tiff-package-example">Using findLinkingOrder with RTools42 (tiff package example)</h3>
<p>This example uses RTools42 and binary build of R. Run Rtools42 shell (Msys2 bash), download and extract the source package <code>tiff</code>. Create a temporary <code>Makevars.ucrt</code> file as follows:</p>
<pre><code>PKG_LIBS = -Wl,--no-demangle $(shell cat /tmp/tiff.libs)</code></pre>
<p>Get the <code>findLinkingOrder</code> tool</p>
<pre><code>svn checkout https://svn.r-project.org/R-dev-web/trunk/WindowsBuilds/winutf8/ucrt3/linking_order</code></pre>
<p>Run the tool, specifying the file to hold the found linking order:</p>
<pre><code>./linking_order/findLinkingOrder tiff /tmp/tiff.libs</code></pre>
<p>First time, it will take long as it will be creating an index of the libraries. The end of the output is:</p>
<pre><code>Installation failed, trying to find required link order
 -ltiff

Saved in /tmp/tiff.libs</code></pre>
<p>Which means, that the linking was not successful (indeed, we provided no libraries), but we know that the directly missing symbols will be satisfied by <code>-ltiff</code>, which was automatically added. So lets simply run the tool again:</p>
<pre><code>./linking_order/findLinkingOrder tiff /tmp/tiff.libs</code></pre>
<p>The output now ends with:</p>
<pre><code>Installation failed, trying to find required link order
-ltiff -lzstd -lz -lwebpdecoder -lwebp -llzma -ljpeg -lcfitsio

Saved in /tmp/tiff.libs</code></pre>
<p>Which means that <code>-ltiff</code> was not enough, but there is an extended suggestions. Lets run the tool the same way again. The output ends with</p>
<pre><code>Installation succeeded!</code></pre>
<p>Which means the list of libraries is complete. So now we can modify the <code>Makevars.ucrt</code> using the computed list of libraries:</p>
<pre><code>PKG_LIBS=-ltiff -lzstd -lz -lwebpdecoder -lwebp -llzma -ljpeg -lcfitsio</code></pre>
<p>The <code>-Wl,--no-demangle</code> option is removed, because it is only needed for the tool (and only for code using C++).</p>
<h2 id="troubleshooting-library-loading-failures">Troubleshooting library loading failures</h2>
<p>Sometimes a package DLL is linked succesfully, but the DLL cannot be loaded. Sometimes it can be loaded on the machine where it was built, but not on another machine. One example is the linking of console API present on Windows 10, but not on Windows Server. A common problem why a DLL cannot be loaded is that a dependent DLL is not found (unlike static libraries, DLLs know their dependencies). This is a common problem which can happen on Windows with any toolchain.</p>
<p>When this happens to a DLL linked to an application, such as <code>Rblas</code> linked to <code>R</code>, an error message will appear helpfully saying that <code>Rblas</code> could not be found. However, when such DLL is being loaded explicitly via a Windows API call (to `LoadLibrary), which is the case when loading DLLs of R packages, Windows is unable to say which DLL is missing:</p>
<pre><code>Error: package or namespace load failed for &#39;magick&#39; in inDL(x, as.logical(local
), as.logical(now), ...):
 unable to load shared object &#39;C:/msys64/home/tomas/ucrt3/svn/ucrt3/r_packages/r
inst/library/00LOCK-magick/00new/magick/libs/x64/magick.dll&#39;:
  LoadLibrary failure:  The specified module could not be found.</code></pre>
<p>Note: in the above, <code>magick.dll</code> is present on the path listed. It is some of its dependencies that is not found, but Windows would tell which one. The confusing error message comes directly from Windows and R cannot possibly fix that.</p>
<p>There is still a way to debug this. One can install <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/">WinDbg</a> from Microsoft (for free), which also includes <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/gflags">gflags</a>.</p>
<p>Using <code>gflags /i Rterm.exe +sls</code> (note <code>gflags</code> gets installed to <code>C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Debuggers\x64\</code>) set “loaded snaps” for the R executable. Then run R, get its process ID using <code>Sys.getpid()</code>, start <code>WinDbg</code>, attach to the R process via that process ID, type ‘g’ (to continue running). In the R process, try to load the problematic package, e.g. <code>library(magick)</code>. This will produce a number of messages, but in this case, one of them was</p>
<pre><code>3e94:29f8 @ 674068078 - LdrpProcessWork - ERROR: Unable to load DLL: &quot;api-ms-win-core-console-l1-2-0.dll&quot;, Parent Module: &quot;C:\msys64\home\tomas\ucrt3\svn\ucrt3\r\build_opt\trunk\library\magick\libs\x64\magick.dll&quot;, Status: 0xc0000135</code></pre>
<p>Which made it clear that <code>api-ms-win-core-console-l1-2-0.dll</code> was the missing DLL.</p>
<p>The flag can be removed using <code>-sls</code>. Note that the Msys2 console (mintty with bash, by default) is very different from cmd.exe in Windows: the latter uses a different API and e.g. sometimes shows more debugging messages, etc. It is better to use cmd.exe when debugging (with <code>WinDbg</code> but also gdb). One may use <code>gdb</code> from Msys2 with this toolchain the same way as with Rtools4.</p>
<h2 id="building-other-applications-e.g.-jags-for-ucrt">Building other applications (e.g. JAGS) for UCRT</h2>
<p>R packages are sometimes linked against dynamic libraries installed by external applications. It may become necessary to rebuild such libraries as well to be built for UCRT. It is advisable for encodings to be handled properly (yet that depends on how that library handles encodings), but it may be the least inconvenient solution also to avoid other clashes between runtimes, such as in memory allocation.</p>
<p><a href="http://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net/">JAGS</a> (Just Another Gibbs Sampler) is used by R package rjags and some other packages. JAGS is installed as a standalone application via its interactive installer and includes shared libraries (JAGS library and a number of modules) and C headers. R packages at build time use those C headers and link against that JAGS shared library.</p>
<p>When R package rjags is built with the UCRT toolchain, so linked against the JAGS library from the official JAGS 4 distribution, it does not work. The linking of the R package library is successful, but building of the package indices fail, unfortunately without any detailed error message. The problem is that building of package indices already involves loading the rjags package and running it, and that crashes because of C runtime mismatch, the JAGS library built for MSVCRT ends up calling UCRT free function on an object allocated using MSVCRT.</p>
<p>To resolve this, JAGS has been rebuilt for UCRT using this experimental toolchain. The installer is available <a href="https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/winutf8/ucrt3/extra/jags">here</a> and the script used to build it is available <a href="https://svn.r-project.org/R-dev-web/trunk/WindowsBuilds/winutf8/ucrt3/extra/jags">here</a>.</p>
<p>The tricks needed to build JAGS follow and some may be needed when natively building other applications as well.</p>
<p>First, JAGS uses libtool for linking. Some libraries in MXE, and luckily most of those used by JAGS have libtool control files (<code>.la</code> extension), but by libtool design these files include hard-coded directories that are filled when the toolchain is built, so a PATH on some Linux machine. The <code>.la</code> files had to be fixed manually to include the hard-coded directory on the Windows machine where they are installed (using <code>sed -i -e</code>).</p>
<p>Then, JAGS uses <code>configure</code>, but when running in Msys2, the host system identification is different from what the MXE-built toolchain has, so some utilities (but not all) are not detected correctly. <code>configure</code> has to be run with <code>--host=x86_64-w64-mingw32.static.posix</code>).</p>
<p>Futhermore, as documented in JAGS installation manual, libtool will not link a static library to a shared library created as “module. This causes trouble for some JAGS modules, such as”bugs", which link against LAPACK and BLAS. The UCRT toolchain includes static libraries for reference LAPACK and BLAS, but libtool refuses to link them (also, they don’t have <code>.la</code> files).</p>
<p>This can be solved by building wrapper dynamic libraries for these static LAPACK and BLAS libraries, following instructions from the JAGS manual, with the toolchain on PATH (as when building R and packages):</p>
<pre><code>export TLIB=~/svn/ucrt3/r/x86_64-w64-mingw32.static.posix/lib
dlltool -z libblas.def --export-all-symbols $TLIB/libblas.a
gfortran -shared -o libblas.dll -Wl,--out-implib=libblas.dll.a libblas.def $TLIB/libblas.a
dlltool -z liblapack.def --export-all-symbols $TLIB/liblapack.a
gfortran -shared -o liblapack.dll -Wl,--out-implib=liblapack.dll.a liblapack.def $TLIB/liblapack.a  -L. -lblas</code></pre>
<p>One can then provide these libraries to JAGS configure via <code>-with-blas="-L$TLHOME -lblas" --with-lapack="-L$TLHOME -llapack"</code>, where <code>XXX</code> is the directory with <code>liblapack.dll</code> and <code>libblas.dll</code>. These two DLLs have to be then copied into the JAGS build tree before running the installer:</p>
<pre><code>./configure --host=x86_64-w64-mingw32.static.posix --with-blas=&quot;-L$TLHOME -lblas&quot; --with-lapack=&quot;-L $TLHOME -llapack&quot;
make win64-install
cp $TLHOME/libblas.dll $TLHOME/liblapack.dll win/inst64/bin
make installer</code></pre>
<p>But, before running <code>make installer</code>, one needs to fix the installer script for 64-bit-only build. The original installer supported both 32-bit and 64-bit architecture, but the experimental toolchain only supports 64-bit. The patch is available with the build script, <a href="https://svn.r-project.org/R-dev-web/trunk/WindowsBuilds/winutf8/ucrt3/extra/jags">here</a>.</p>
