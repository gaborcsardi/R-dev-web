These are resources to build JAGS 4.3.0 for UCRT, which is needed for using
JAGS with R packages in the UCRT builds of R. The resulting installer
executable is now available at 

https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/winutf8/ucrt3/extra/jags/

For an upstream version maintained directly by Martyn Plummer, please see

https://sourceforge.net/projects/mcmc-jags/files/

but it doesn't have a UCRT build at the time of this writing, yet.
