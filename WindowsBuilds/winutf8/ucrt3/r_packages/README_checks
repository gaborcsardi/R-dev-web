These R package checks are run on Windows using a patched version of R-devel
and a new toolchain (GCC 10 with UCRT as the Windows runtime).  The main
purpose of this toolchain is to allow UTF-8 as the current native encoding
on Windows, which would be a major step in fixing most encoding problems R
users encounter on Windows.  All native code including R, R packages and all
external libraries have to be rebuilt for UCRT using the new toolchain.  The
use of UCRT requires a newer version of MinGW-w64 and GCC than Rtools4,
hence newer versions of some external libraries, and hence some adaptations
to R packages with native code.

Please see [2] for more information about this build of R and toolchain,
which are both available in source and binary forms for use by package
authors and users wishing to test development versions of R.  See [9] for a
demo how to use the new toolchain to check packages with GitHub actions on
GitHub.  The R-Hub service [10] for checking packages supports this
toolchain.  See [8] for instructions how to set up a virtual machine to
test/debug packages on Windows using this toolchain and a free
(time-limited) virtual machine provided by Microsoft for software testing.

As a temporary measure to help package maintainers to fix their packages to
work with this toolchain, and to allow R end users test R and packages with
inputs using multi-byte characters, this version of R automatically patches
some CRAN packages to work with the toolchain.  This is clearly indicated in
installation logs and in binary builds of the respective packages.  Package
maintainers who wish their packages to keep working with this toolchain are
invited to reuse any parts of these fixes from these fixes in their code and
then ask for the patches to be removed.

This version of R automatically applies the patches also during the CRAN
checks.  

See [1] for the necessary components to reproduce these checks 

  R-devel-win-*.exe .......... is a binary installer of (patched) R-devel
  R-devel-win-dbg*.exe ....... a debug build of the same
  
  CRAN/bin, BIOC/bin ......... binary CRAN packages and several of their
                               BIOC dependencies, some patched, built for
                               UCRT, automatically used by the patched R

  gcc10_ucrt3_full_*.tar.zst . the toolchain and libraries

  gcc10_ucrt3_base_*.tar.zst . the toolchain and subset of libraries,
                               enough to build R and recommended packages,
                               but probably also many other CRAN packages

  gcc10_ucrt3_cross_*.tar.zst
                             . the cross-compilation toolchain, so be used
                               on Linux with the "base" or "full" bundle
                               of libraries (currently only used to build
                               Tcl/Tk bundle)

  Tcl-*.zip .................. Tcl/Tk bundle, needed to build R from source


  rtools42-*.exe ............. preview version of Rtools42 with the toolchain
                               and libraries

  R-devel-*.diff ............. patches for R
  patches .................... patches for R packages

  *.stamp .................... stamp files informing about versioning

These components are rebuilt automatically.  In some cases the R installer
or R binary builds may be newer than those used for the check results.  The
exact versions can be identified with the help of stamp files:

  r_packages_4413_built_by_R-devel-win-79975-4413-4413.exe.stamp
  r_packages_4413_checked_by_R-devel-win-79975-4413-4413.exe.stamp

These give the full name of the R installer: R-devel-win-79975-4413-4413.exe

For reference, the relation of the version numbers in different components
is as follows:

  R devel patch R-devel-79975-4413.diff ........ R-devel 79975, R patches 4413
  R toolchain gcc10_ucrt3_full_4413.tar.zst..... toolchain 4413
  Rtools42 rtools42-4413-4741.exe .............. toolchain 4413, R tools 4741

  R installer R-devel-win-79975-4413-4413.exe .. R-devel 79975, toolchain 4413,
                                                 R patches 4413

  Tcl/Tk bundle Tcl-4413-4415.zip .............. toolchain 4413, tcl/tk 4415

  R package patches 4413 (the first number after "r_packages_" in the .stamp)

The 4413 in the example is SVN revision from R-dev-web [3], which hosts the
toolchain, R patches, R package patches and scripts.  It is sampled when the
different subcomponents are taken, hence many subcomponents may have the
same version.

The checks are run on Windows Server 2022 with UTF-8 as the current native
and system encoding.  UTF-8 as native encoding is also supported on Windows
10 and newer (since Windows 10 version 1903) and on Windows Server 1903 from
the semi-annual channel.  Older versions of Windows will use the locale code
page as R 4.1 and earlier versions.

UCRT is available in all versions of Windows 10, Windows Server 2016 (and
newer), and can be installed to older versions of Windows, including Vista,
7, 8, 8.1, Server 2008, Server 2012 [6,5].  This build of R and the
toolchain will therefore already work on those systems, and the check
results should be reproducible there, except for that they'd still not be
able to use UTF-8 as the current native encoding.  Note that systems running
Windows 7 or 8.1, if they meet the hardware requirements, may be freely
upgraded to Windows 10.
