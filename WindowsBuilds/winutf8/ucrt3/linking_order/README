findLinkingOrder is a script which suggests libraries (and their order) to
link to an R package to satisfy its undefined symbols.

On the first execution, the script creates an index of symbols in available
libraries.  On every execution, the script tries to install a given R
package (possibly with under-specified or no libraires).  When the
installation fails, the script looks for "undefined symbol" (linker errors)
and suggests libraries to link.  The script only looks for directly required
symbols, so it is to be used iteratively until there are no undefined
symbols.  Also, one may have to adjust manually the list of libraries at
some iterations.

See findLinkingOrder comments (and ../howto.md) for more information.
