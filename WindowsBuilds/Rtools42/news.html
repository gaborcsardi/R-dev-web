</header>
<h3 id="section">5355</h3>
<p>Distributed as rtools42-5355-5357.exe.</p>
<p>The biggest changes are in geospatial libraries. Gdal is now built with support for kea and blosc. Spatialite is no longer built with support for rttopo. Hdf5 is now built with szip support (using aec library). Proj major version has been upgraded to 8, which comes with datum ensembles and no longer supports PROJ.4. Gdal minor version has been upgraded to 3.5. These changes require adaptations in linking orders in R packages (Makevars.ucrt files), including ncdf4, rgdal, sf and terra.</p>
<p>Upstream MXE changes have been merged from <code>b11aaa7123c59cde7bb5e9ff794c672f54b706c3</code>. In addition to numerous package updates, including GCC (update to 10.4), <code>qt6-qtbase</code> has been added and <code>llvm</code> has been removed. R packages linking to glib-2.0 now also need to link uuid (R package RcppCWB).</p>

<p>Building MXE packages for Rtools now requires also these Ubuntu/Debian packages: python3, python3-mako, python3-setuptools. See <a href="https://mxe.cc/">MXE documentation</a> for the corresponding packages for other Linux distributions.</p>
<p>Rtools toolchain+libraries bundle now contains also the list of version of the Rtools MXE packages installed in file installed.list.</p>
<p>MinGW-W64 has been kept at version 9.0.0. A number of Rtools-specific fixes has been contributed upstream to MXE.</p>
<h3 id="section-2">5168</h3>
<p>Distibuted as rtools42-5168-5107.exe when R 4.2.0 was released.</p>
<p>The C++ library is built with precise timers (â€“enable-libstdcxx-time). This fixes issues with packages such as benchr that depend on these.</p>
<p>The distribution of the cross toolchain has been improved wrt to handling ccache. The documentation on building R and packages (<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/howto-R-4.2.html">R-4.2.x</a> and <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/howto-R-devel.html">R-devel</a>) has been updated with examples on how to use the cross toolchain. The documentation also describes how to set up a build tree of MXE packages using the cross toolchain bundle, instead of building all needed Rtools MXE packages from source.</p>
<h3 id="and-older">5111 and older</h3>
<p>Changes between any two Rtools42 releases can be found in the versioning system using a subversion client. To list differences between 5111 and 5168:</p>
<pre><code>svn log -r 5111:5168 https://svn.r-project.org/R-dev-web/trunk/WindowsBuilds/winutf8/ucrt3/toolchain_libs</code></pre>
<p>And to see the detailed diff:</p>
<pre><code>svn diff -r 5111:5168 https://svn.r-project.org/R-dev-web/trunk/WindowsBuilds/winutf8/ucrt3/toolchain_libs</code></pre>
<p>The corresponding changes in the Tcl/Tk bundle and Rtools42 installer can be found the same way in these subversion repositories:</p>
<pre><code>https://svn.r-project.org/R-dev-web/trunk/WindowsBuilds/winutf8/ucrt3/tcl_bundle
https://svn.r-project.org/R-dev-web/trunk/WindowsBuilds/winutf8/ucrt3/rtools</code></pre>
<p>Please only refer to changes between subversion revisions of Rtools42 distributed at <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/rtools42/files/">https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/rtools42/files/</a>. Intermediate and newer revisions are work in progress and may not be functional.</p>
