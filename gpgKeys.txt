While I visiting with Martin in Zürich he created a GPG key and we
signed each others' keys.  This can be done from the command line or
through various interfaces such as the OpenPGP Key Management window
in the EnigMail extension for Mozilla Thunderbird.  On the command
line it looks like

gpg --gen-key  # begins an interactive dialog - we selected DSA

gpg --armor --export <name>  | mail <otheruser>@R-project.org

When the otheruser receives the email they use some interface to
import the key into their keyring then sign it and mail it back to the
originator.  Signing is done by

gpg --edit-key <otheruser>  # begins an interactive dialog
sign    # requires your secret passphrase
quit

Mailing the signed key back to the originator can be done as above.
