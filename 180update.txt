Updating packages for 1.8.0
===========================

Package maintainers should be aware of the following changes scheduled
to appear in 1.8.0.


print.coefmat (which was not a print method) has been deprecated and
replaced by printCoefmat.  By default NAs are not suppressed: should
this be desired call printCoefmat(..., na.print="").
