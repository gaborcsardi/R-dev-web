Updating packages for 1.8.0
===========================

Package maintainers should be aware of the following changes scheduled
to appear in 1.8.0.


print.coefmat (which was not a print method) has been deprecated and
replaced by printCoefmat.  By default NAs are not suppressed: should
this be desired call printCoefmat(..., na.print="").


coef() and coef<-() have been deprecated.  They did not use the
internal codes of an unordered factor, and in almost all cases
unclass/as.vector/as.integer was intended.  There is no replacment for 
codes<-(), but it appears to be unused on CRAN.
