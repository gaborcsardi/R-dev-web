<h1>Todo List for R for Duncan Temple Lang</h1>

The following is an unordered list of items that I intend to work on
that relate to R.  (There are others, but I am not admitting to the
them.)  The time frame for these is completely uncertain.  I am very
keen to hear peoples' suggestion of which should be done first, etc.

<hr width="75%">
<dl>

  <dt>
  <li> Structuring the Event Loop.
  <dd> We want to be able to host other systems
       such as Tcl/Tk, Gtk applications, etc.
      and allow them to integrate their event sources into
      our event loop.
      Similarly, we need to be able to do the reverse when
      R is embedded in other applications.
      <p>
      The  immediate things to do are
      <ul>
	<li> Replace the current <code>PolledEvents</code> setup
	     with a linked-list approach managed centrally
	    in the same way that <code>addInputHander</code> works.
	<li> Provide routines in the Tcl/Tk library to implement
	    the Tcl Notifier mechanism so that Tcl event sources
	    are handled by the R event loop. 
	    Also, we can do a similar thing for Gtk facilities.
	<li> Provide implementations of R's <code>addInputHandler()</code>,
	    <code>addPolledEventHandler()</code>, etc. that pass the information
	    to Tcl/Tk, Gtk, etc. when R is embedded in those applications.

	<li> Add new event sources
	    <ul>
	      <li> <code>setReader()</code> for connections,
	      <li> timer events,
	      <li> signals,
	      <li> potentially, assignments, idle tasks,
		   etc.
	    </ul>
	    
      </ul>
      
  <dt>
  <li> Extending the "database" concept to provide 
       support for S4-style user defined elements
       of the search path.
  <dd>

      This is needed generally by many of the
      inter-system interface packages.
       These include the Perl, Java, Python, JavaScript
       interfaces, and also packages such as
      CORBA, RPgSQL, RMySQL, etc. which can richly
      exploit the concept of a proxy object
      or a foreign reference. Much of this has been
      done in the Omegahat language and the
      setup there can be implemented here.

  <dt>
  <li> C-level API for embedding R.
  <dd> Including exceptions which Robert is implementing
      for R.


  <dt>
  <li> Integrating Tom Vogel's mechanism for
       <a
href="http://www.ece.cmu.edu/~tov/public/R/X11andTk.html">using a Tk
widget as an X11 device canvas</a>.
  <dd> This should be relatively easy given the changes motivated
      by the SNetscape package for using an arbitrary X <code>Window</code>
      structure.
      
  <dt>
  <li> Packages
  <dd> I continuing to  develop several packages.
	<dl>
	  <dt>
          <a href="http://www.omegahat.org/RGnumeric">RGnumeric</a>
	  <dd> A plugin for Gnumeric that allows R functions
	      to be called from Gnumeric and for these functions
	      to access Gnumeric workbooks, sheets and cells.

        <dt> <a href="http://www.omegahat.org/SNetscape">SNetscape</a>
	<dd>
	    Fixing the event queue problem associated with
	    the embedded graphics devices is urgent here.
	    Also, using S foreign references needs to be added.
	<dt> SXalan (and using libxslt).
        <dd>
	<dt> <a href="http://www.omegahat.org/RSPostgres">REmbeddedPostgres</a>
        <dd> using R functions within SQL queries
	       that are executed in the server via an embedded R.
	<dt> RSHelp
	<dd>documentation mechanism using XML
	    
	<dt> SXMLObjects
        <dd> Serializing S (R and S-Plus) objects
	    in XML format so that they can be read  and written
	    by other systems (e.g. each other, Matlab, SAS, etc.)

	<dt> <a href="http://www.ggobi.org/RSggobi.html">Rggobi</a>
	<dd> An interface for embedding ggobi in R.
      </dl>
 Work on others such as
      <a href="http://www.omegahat.org/RSPerl">RSPerl</a>,
      <a href="http://www.omegahat.org/Java">SJava</a>,
      <a href="http://www.omegahat.org/RSPython">Python</a>,
      <a href="http://www.omegahat.org/XML">XML</a>

      
     
      

  <dt>
  <li> R as a shared library &amp; shared libraries.
  <dd> It is useful for both technical and non-technical
      reasons to always use the R engine as a shared library.

      <ul>
	<li> This simplifies providing different front ends
       such as GUIs, command lines, embedding, 
          and makes these uniform;
	<li> simplifies some dynamic     loading issues;
	<li> licensing uncertainties may become clearer.
      </ul>
      We can pursue this further, making more than
      just the Rmath library 
      available as separately usable components of the
      R engine. For example, we might be able to
      allow certain parts of the graphics engine and devices
      be used  in other applications, separately from the rest of R.
      
    <dt>
    <li> Integrating an XSLT translator into R
    <dd> As opposed to the SXalan package which embeds R in
	an XSL translator, this would allow us to "out-source"
	sub-computations  for XML operations, such as when
	processing help files that contain style rather than
	top-level structural information.

    <dt>
    <li> Interactive graphics.
    <dd> It may be interesting to allow users events on graphics devices
	to be programmable at the user-level.
	And then take this to a level of abstraction that makes
	it platform neutral.
	
  <dt>
  <li> An interface generator like <a href="http://www.swig.org">SWIG</a>
  <dd> Using Lcc, we can parse  C code and extract
       the structure and routine definitions.
      Using this information, we can
      automatically generate S and C code
      that interfaces to these and provide quick and easy access to
       "arbitrary" C code.


  <dt>
  <li> Internal and User-level threads in the S language.
  <dd> Luke and I are working on getting concurrency
      and potentially parallelism in R
      so that one can (at least appear to) be
      executing different commands simultaneously.
      Ideally we will be able to exploit multiple
      processors in a machine and run certain
      computations in parallel.
      <p>
    To do this, we need to
      <ul>
	<li> provide support multiple interpreters
	     and this involves removing all the global variables.
	    This is underway.
	<li> Luke is investigating the extent to which
	    the <code>eval()</code> can be made non-recursive.
	    This has the potential to make it possible for us
            to schedule different interpreters ourselves
	    without the need for operating system threads.
      </ul>

<p>
      Hopefully we will also be able to
      provide an interface which supports
      both process-level threads and distributed
      computing across machines.
      
  <dt>
  <li> Safe Interpreter
  <dd> When R is embedded in applications such as
       a Database server, Netscape, security issues
       arise as one can evaluate arbitrary S code
       including system calls,
       and also load and invoke arbitrary C code.
        We need to provide a minimal interpreter
      that prohibits execution of these and potentially
      other functions.
      This needs to be configurable for different
      installation sites, user groups, etc.
