<h1 align="center">Translating R Messages</h1>

As from version 2.1.0, R supports the translation of its messages,
including error and warning messages and menu labels.  This document
is intended for translation teams but starts with a user's view of the
process extracted from the <em>R Installation and Administration
Manual</em>.

The MacOS X GUI also has translatable messages: see the separate
section at the end of this document.

<h2>Message Domains</h2>

<p>Messages are divided into <em>domains</em>, and translations may
be available for some or all messages in a domain.  R makes use of the
following domains.

<ul>
<li>Domain <code>R</code> for basic C-level error messages.

<li>Domain <code>R-</code><var>pkg</var> for the R <code>stop</code>
and <code>warning</code> messages in each package, including
<code>R-base</code> for the <code>base</code> package.

<li>Domain <var>pkg</var> for the C-level messages in each package.

<li>Domain <code>RGui</code> for the menus etc of the R for Windows
GUI front-end.

</ul>

<p>Dividing up the messages in this way allows R to be extensible: as
packages are loaded, their message translation catalogues can be loaded
too.

<p>Translations are looked for by domain according to the currently
specified language, as specifically as possible, so for example an
Austrian (<code>de_AT</code>) translation catalogue will be used in
preference to a generic German one (<code>de</code>) for an Austrian
user.  Translations in the right language but the wrong charset can
generally be made use of by on-the-fly re-encoding.  The
<code>LANGUAGE</code> variable (only) can be a colon-separated list,
for example <code>se:de</code>, giving a set of languages in
decreasing order of preference.

<p>If no suitable translation catalogue is found or a particular message
is not translated in that catalogue, English is used.

The translated catalogues are stored as binary files with extension
<code>.mo</code>.  Those for domains <code>R</code> and
<code>RGui</code> are under <code>R_HOME/share/locale</code> and the
package-specific catalogues under the <code>po</code> directory of the
installed package (and so need to be under <code>inst/po</code> in the
sources).  These directories contain one directory for each
translation identified by language, e.g. <code>se</code> or
<code>de_AT</code>.  Each language directory has a subdirectory
<code>LC_MESSAGES</code>, and within that files for each domain.  So
an R installation will contain at least files
<pre>
share/locale/en/LC_MESSAGES/R.mo
share/locale/en@quot/LC_MESSAGES/R.mo
library/splines/po/en/LC_MESSAGES/R-splines.mo
library/splines/po/en/LC_MESSAGES/splines.mo
</pre>
(The `language' <code>en@quot</code> is English with Unicode
bidirectional quotation marks for use in a UTF-8 locale.)

<h2>Translation prerequisites</h2>

You need GNU <code>gettext</code> installed: specifically
<code>gettext-tools</code> if your system differentiates it from
<code>gettext-runtime</code>.  (Linux users will not need the
development RPM.)  The <code>gettext</code> manual is the best
reference source.

Emacs users can use PO mode to help with managing translations: this
is described in the <code>gettext</code> manual.

<h2>Preparing and installing a translation</h2>

Suppose you wanted to prepare a Slovenian translation for the
<code>splines</code> package.  The ISO 639 code for Slovenian is
<code>sl</code>.  Go to the <code>src/library/splines/po</code>
directory and run (preferably in a Slovenian locale)
<pre>
msginit -i R-splines.pot -o R-sl.po
msginit -i splines.pot -o sl.po
</pre>

<p>Now check over the header entries and fill in the
<code>msgstr</code> entries in these files.  The originals will look
like
<pre>
# Slovenian translations for R package
# Slovenski prevodi paketa R.
# Copyright (C) 2005 THE R'S COPYRIGHT HOLDER
# This file is distributed under the same license as the R package.
# Prof Brian Ripley &lt;ripley@stats.ox.ac.uk&gt;, 2005.
#
msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Project-Id-Version: R 2.1.0\n"
"Report-Msgid-Bugs-To: bugs@r-project.org\n"
"POT-Creation-Date: 2005-01-25 17:26+0000\n"
"PO-Revision-Date: 2005-02-04 08:37+0000\n"
"Last-Translator: Prof Brian Ripley &lt;ripley@stats.ox.ac.uk&gt;\n"
"Language-Team: Slovenian\n"
"MIME-Version: 1.0\n"
"Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-2\n"
"Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit\n"
"Plural-Forms: nplurals=4; plural=(n%100==1 ? 0 : n%100==2 ? 1 : n%100==3 || n"
"%100==4 ? 2 : 3);\n"

#: splines.c:154
msgid "'ord' must be a positive integer"
msgstr ""
</pre>
If you leave a translation as <code>""</code> the untranslated message
(<code>msgid</code>) will be used.

<p>Then compile and install the translated catalogues by
<pre>
mkdir ../inst/po/LC_MESSAGES/sl
msgfmt -o ../inst/po/LC_MESSAGES/sl/R-splines.mo R-sl.po
msgfmt -o ../inst/po/LC_MESSAGES/sl/splines.mo sl.po
</pre>
and when you next install the package the translations will be ready
for use.

<p> The process for the domains <code>R</code> and <code>RGui</code>
is almost identical: their template files <code>R.pot</code> and
<code>RGui.pot</code> are in the <code>po</code> subdirectory of the R
sources and they are installed to
<code>share/locale/sl/LC_MESSAGES</code>. Automated installation is
possible by adding your language to the <code>po/LINGUAS</code> file.

<h2>Submitting a translation</h2>

To submit a translation for inclusion in the R sources please make a
<code>tar</code> with all the files you added, perhaps by (untested)
<pre>
tar zcvf sl-po.tar,gz po/*sl.po share/locale/sl \
  src/library/*/po/*sl.po src/library/inst/po/sl
</pre>
and send it to the R core team.

Translations of messages in recommended packages should be sent to
their maintainers.
