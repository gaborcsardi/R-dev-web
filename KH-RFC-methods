				Dear Emacs, make this -*-Text-*- mode!

* Methods must have all arguments of the generic, including `...' if the
  generic does; conversely, a generic should have all arguments of the
  standard methods.

* All print methods should have arguments `digits', `quote' and
  `justify' (in that order), if relevant.

* Upon introducing a new generic, use `x' for the name of its first
  argument if that is the one used for method dispatch (as it almost
  always is).
