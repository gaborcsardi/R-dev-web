Updating packages for 2.7.0
===========================

Package maintainers should be aware of the following changes scheduled
to appear in 2.7.0 sometime in April 2008.


Graphics Devices
================

This section applies to graphics devices in packages.  The standard
package 'grDevices' and the X11 device in src/modules/X11 provide
reference examples.

The API has been changed, and although the old API is currently
still supported, please update to the new and cleaner API.

1) The only graphics header required is

#include <R_ext/GraphicsEngine.h>

(which includes GraphicsDevice.h>.  Rgraphics.h is part of the base
graphics system, and should not be included.  Nor should Rdevices.h.

2) Initialization of newDevStruct in either a NewDevDesc or a
GEDevDesc is an error, as is initialization of the unused components
dot, hold and open of a NewDevDesc.  (Packages almost certainly need
an Open function themselves, but it is never called by the R engine.)

3) Define R_USE_PROTOTYPES to 1 check the prototypes in the callbacks
set in the NewDevDesc.  (This is optional as some users have passed
their own structures rather than a NewDevDesc -- this may not 
continue to work, but defining R_USE_PROTOTYPES to 0 removes the check.)

4) There should be no references to DevDesc in the package code.  This
is likely to need replacements as follows:

   addDevice 	  GEaddDevice
   GetDevice	  GEGetDevice
   KillDevice	  GEkillDevice
   CurrentDevice  GEcurrentDevice

all of which take a GEDevDesc* as an argument, and 

   devNumber      ndevNumber

which takes a NewDevDesc* as an argument.

5) A frequent construction is to find the GEDevDesc corresponding to
a NewDevDesc, for example to replay the display list or to kill the
device.  This used to be of the form

    KillDevice((DevDesc*) GetDevice(devNumber((DevDesc*) dd)));

(from devX11.c), which was particularly egregious as a NewDevDesc*
was being case to a DevDesc*.  This has been replaced by

    killDevice(ndevNumber(dd));

but there is a convenience function

    pGEDevDesc desc2GEDesc(NewDevDesc *dd)

to find the enclosing GEDevDesc.
