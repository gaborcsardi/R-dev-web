Updating packages for 2.0.0
===========================

Package maintainers should be aware of the following changes scheduled
to appear in 2.0.0.


1) Package R code should only create R objects via assignments
   (possibly conditionally), and not execute functions with side
   effects such as require() and options() -- the latter should be in
   .First.lib or .onLoad (the latter for packages with namespaces).

   This is necessary to allow the `lazy loading' of R objects.
