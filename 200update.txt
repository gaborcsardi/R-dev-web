Updating packages for 2.0.0
===========================

Package maintainers should be aware of the following changes scheduled
to appear in 2.0.0.


1) Package R code should only create R objects via assignments
   (possibly conditionally), and not execute functions with side
   effects such as require() and options() -- the latter should be in
   .First.lib or .onLoad (the latter for packages with namespaces).
   They should also not be in `install.R'!

   This is necessary to allow the `lazy loading' of R objects.


2) data/*.R files must be self-sufficient, and in particular not
   depend on the package or standard packages other than base.
   If necessary, include a call like

       require(foo, quietly = TRUE, save = FALSE)

   in the .R file.


3) When a package is installed, all the data sets are loaded to see
   what they produce.  If this is undesirable (because they are
   enormous, or depend on other packages that need to be installed
   later, ...), add a `datalist' file to the data subdirectory as
   described in `Writing R Extensions'.


4) If your package uses an empty install.R just to force the save of
   an image, consider replacing it by either

       SaveImage: yes

   or

       LazyLoad: yes

   fields in your DESCRIPTION file, preferably the latter except for
   small packages.
