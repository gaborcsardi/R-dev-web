Updating packages for 2.0.0
===========================

Package maintainers should be aware of the following changes scheduled
to appear in 2.0.0.


1) Package R code should only create R objects via assignments
   (possibly conditionally), and not execute functions with side
   effects such as require() and options() -- the latter should be in
   .First.lib or .onLoad (the latter for packages with namespaces).
   They should also not be in `install.R'!

   This is necessary to allow the `lazy loading' of R objects.

2) data/*.R files must be self-sufficient, and in particular not
   depend on the package or standard packages other than base.
   If necessary, include a call like

       require(foo, quietly = TRUE, save = FALSE)

   in the .R file.
