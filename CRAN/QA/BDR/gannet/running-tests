I now run my tests only on 8-core Xeon or 4-core Core i7 boxes.

Xvfb :5 -screen 0 1280x1024x24 &
setenv DISPLAY :5

setenv _R_CHECK_FORCE_SUGGESTS_ FALSE
setenv UDUNITS_LIBDIR /usr/lib64
setenv RMPI_INCLUDE /usr/include/openmpi-x86_64
setenv RMPI_LIB_PATH /usr/lib64/openmpi/lib
setenv RMPI_TYPE OPENMPI
setenv R_BROWSER false
setenv R_PDFVIEWER false

make -j12 -k &

This usually manages to keep the 8 processors running at close to 100% 
In the past various packages have needed to be checked without parallel make,
but only farmR and some versions of AffyTiling in BioC 2.54 are now exceptions:
there is a provision in the Makefile for such packages.

There are problems with several packages leaving processes running,
and these can mount up.  I now avoid acroread and firefox instances
by setting R_BROWSER and R_PDFVIEWER in 'script', and skip the examples in
dynGraph as it leaves 2 java instances running.

~ripley/R/test-library has an install of all the packages I can
install, including the off-CRAN package yags and I also have almost all
BioC and some Omegahat packages.  I cannot install

RDieHarder	broken configure
ROracle		no 64-bit Oracle
RQuantLib	need later QuantLib than F12 has
RScaLAPACK	does not work with F12's RPMs
Rcplex		no support software
Rlsf		no support software
VhayuR		is really Windows-only, and needs commercial software there
cudaBayesreg	GPU is not recent enough
gputools	ditto

Then Rserve, rscproxy and JRI (used by Deducer and gWidgetsrJava) need
R as a shared library and do not check.

The BioC installations need to be matched to the version of R: e.g.
BioC-2.5 is for 2.10.x.
