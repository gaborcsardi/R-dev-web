Updating packages for 2.1.0
===========================

Package maintainers should be aware of the following changes scheduled
to appear in 2.1.0 sometime in April 2005.


1) It is possible to run R in UTF-8 and other internationalized
   locales.  This necessitates some changes to packages that use other
   than ASCII character strings, even for personal names.  The
   principal difference is that in UTF-8 more that one byte may be
   needed to represent a character, and indeed all non-ASCII
   characters need at least two.  On the other hand, ASCII characters
   can only occur as themselves and never as part of multi-byte sequences.

   - .Rd pages with non-ASCII strings (often personal names) should
     declare the encoding via \encoding.

  -  Other text documentation, especially the DESCRIPTION file, should
     use ASCII only if possible, and failing that Latin-1 (and not,
     say, UTF-8).

  -  R code should be ASCII.  Do not use non-ASCII characters in
     object names, for example, for if someone runs your package
     in the C locale it will fail.

  -  Names in data objects (e.g. in .rda files) are problematic.  It
     is likely that by release time these will be treated as in
     Latin-1.

  -  C code that does character-by-character access can request an
     particular encoding via the ENCODING= argument to .C.  However,
     this is not guaranteed to honoured but is likely to be so in
     multi-byte character encodings such as UTF-8.
