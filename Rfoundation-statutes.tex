% \section*{Foreword}

% The structure of this statutes is modeled after a template provided by
% the Austrian Ministry of the Interior (which is responsible for
% admission of non-profit associations). Following the template is a
% good idea because many Austrian associations use similar statutes and we
% will probably need no legal advice for passing them. Other sources I
% have used are the statutes of
% the Apache Foundation (\url{http://www.apache.org}),
% GNOME Foundation (\url{http://www.gnome.org}),
% IASC (\url{http://www.iasc-isi.org}),
% the Austrian Statistical Society (\url{http://www.osg.or.at}),
% and the Linux User Group Austria (\url{http://www.luga.or.at});
% the latter two mostly to have examples
% for Austrian associations with similar objectives.

% All text in italics (including this foreword) are comments and will
% not appear in the final document. The document we submit to the
% Austrian authorities must be in German, Kurt and I will translate it
% once we have an agreement on the English version. Everything below is
% of course only meant as a starting point for discussions, and a lot of
% it will be useful even if we establish the foundation not in Austria.

% PS as usual: feel free the improve the wording at any time, the
% vocabulary needed here is not exactly the same as in scientific
% papers (and following a German template usually also does not exactly
% help to improve my English).
