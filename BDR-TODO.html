<ul>
<li>Add internal support for XML, based on <tt>libxml</tt>. [Intended
for 1.3.0.]

<li>More functionality for connections: sockets, URLs, ...<br>
Planned for 1.3.0:
<ul>
<li>User-specified line endings when writing text files.
<li>URI connections, for types at least <tt>file:</tt>,
<tt>http:</tt> and <tt>ftp:</tt>.
<li>Implement a stack of <tt>sink</tt> connections.
<li>Ability to <tt>sink</tt> the error output stream.
</ul>

<li>Port the GraphApp interface used on Windows to Unix, via the Motif
version of GraphApp. [This looks much harder than expected due to lack
of portability of GraphApp.]

<li>Something better than <tt>gam</tt> for additive models. Perhaps
along the lines of BRUTO (in package <tt>mda</tt>). [Package
<tt>mgcv</tt> has since gone a long way in this direction.]

<li>Replace <tt>arima0</tt> by better internal code and a better interface.

<li>More time-series models, e.g. Harvey's structural models.

<li>Something on GLMMs.
</ul>

Already in un-released versions of R:
<ul>
<li>A native PDF graphics driver. [Done for 1.3.0.]

<li>Allow user-specified encodings for postscript output. [Done for 1.3.0.]

</ul>
