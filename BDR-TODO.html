<ul>
<li>A cleaner approach to `files' and URLs.  Probably along the
lines of S4's connections.  [ Test solution is in a CVS branch. ]

<li>An approach to handling binary files. [See the Rstreams package on
CRAN for an interim solution.]

<li>A native PDF graphics driver.

<li>User-specified font families for the postscript driver. [DONE.]

<li>The ability to write WMF on Unix (but it looks as if we know too
little to achieve this).

<li>Port the GraphApp interface used on Windows to Unix, via the Motif
version of GraphApp. [This looks much harder than expected due to lack
of portability of GraphApp.]

<li>Something better than <tt>gam</tt> for additive models. Perhaps
along the lines of BRUTO (in package <tt>mda</tt>).

<li>Replace <tt>arima0</tt> by better internal code and a better interface.

<li>More time-series models, e.g. Harvey's structural models.

<li>Factor analysis.  [Basic code running, need more info on rotations.]
</ul>
