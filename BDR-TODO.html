<ul>
<li>A bitmap graphics device, covering at least png, bmp and jpeg on
UNIX, as we have on Windows already. This will at least partially
replace <tt>dev2bitmap</tt>.  [DONE for 1.1.o]

<li>A cleaner approach to `files' and URLs.  Possibly something along the
lines of S4's connections.

<li>The ability to write WMF on Unix (but it looks as if we know too
little to achieve this).

<li>Port the GraphApp interface used on Windows to Unix, via the Motif
version of GraphApp.

<li>Something better than <tt>gam</tt> for additive models. Perhaps
along the lines of BRUTO (in package <tt>mda</tt>).

<li>Replace <tt>arima0</tt> by better internal code and a better interface.

<li>More time-series models, e.g. Harvey's structural models.
</ul>
