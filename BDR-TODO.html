<ul>
<li>More functionality for connections: sockets, URLs, ...

<li>A native PDF graphics driver. [Done for 1.3.0.]

<li>Allow user-specified encodings for postscript output. [Done for 1.3.0.]

<li>Port the GraphApp interface used on Windows to Unix, via the Motif
version of GraphApp. [This looks much harder than expected due to lack
of portability of GraphApp.]

<li>Something better than <tt>gam</tt> for additive models. Perhaps
along the lines of BRUTO (in package <tt>mda</tt>). [Package
<tt>mgcv</tt> has since gone a long way in this direction.]

<li>Replace <tt>arima0</tt> by better internal code and a better interface.

<li>More time-series models, e.g. Harvey's structural models.
</ul>
