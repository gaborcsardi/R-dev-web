<h2>For R version 1.0</h2>
<ul>
<li> [DONE] Fix <tt>data/examples/help</tt> to look in the loaded
packages, not any old ones with the right name.

<li> [DONE] Allow data directories in working directories.

<li> [DONE] Allowed zipped data directories.

<li> [DONE] Add a try() function.

<li> [DONE] Add by() and merge().

<li> [DONE] Add simulated annealing method fpr optim (contributed by
 Adrian Trapletti),
<li> Tweak line searches in L-BFGS-B in optim and in nlm.

<li> [DONE] Add some means of post-mortem debugging.

</ul>

<h2>Longer term</h2>

<ul>
<li>Replace <tt>arima0</tt> by better internal code and a better interface.

<li>A bitmap graphics device, covering at least png, bmp and jpeg on
UNIX, as we have on Windows already. This will at least partially
replace <tt>dev2bitmap</tt>.

<li>A cleaner approach to `files' and URLs.  Possibly something along the
lines of S4's connections.

<li>The ability to write WMF on Unix (but it looks as if we know too
little to achieve this).

<li>Something better than <tt>gam</tt> for additive models. Perhaps
along the lines of BRUTO (in package <tt>mda</tt>).

<li>More time-series models, e.g. Harvey's structural models.
</ul>
