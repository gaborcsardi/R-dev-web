<h1 align="center">Memory profiling in R</h1> 

Three experimental additions to help in profiling memory use in R programs. This is reorganized from the first version to keep the code and documentation for the time-sampling profiler <code>Rprof</code> separate from the memory profiler <code>Rprofmem</code>

<ul>
<li> <code>Rprof</code> has an option
<code>memory.profiling</code>. When <code>TRUE</code> the profiler
also writes out information the small and large vector heap sizes,
memory in nodes, and number of calls to <code>Rf_duplicate</code> in
the interval.  <code>summaryRprof</code> now has options to summarize this information. 
 This is available only on Unix at the moment.

<li> If R is compiled with <code>--enable-memory-profiling</code>, the function <code>tracemem</code> marks an object so that  a stack trace will be printed  when the object is duplicated, or when it is copied by coercion or arithmetic functions. This is intended for tracking accidental copying of large objects. <code>untracemem</code> will untrace an object (though not all copies of it) and <code>tracingState</code> controls whether tracing information is printed. In the example below we see that <code>lm</code> does not duplicate its <code>data</code>  argument, but that <code>glm</code> does, and that <code>lm</code> does copy the response vector.
<pre>
> data(trees)
> tracemem(trees)
[1] "<0x8bfff28>"
> lm(log(Volume)~log(Height)+log(Girth),data=trees)

Call:
lm(formula = log(Volume) ~ log(Height) + log(Girth), data = trees)

Coefficients:
(Intercept)  log(Height)   log(Girth)
     -6.632        1.117        1.983

>  glm(log(Volume)~log(Height)+log(Girth),data=trees)
memtrace[0x8bfff28->0x8b6d820]: glm
memtrace[0x8b6d820->0x89b4c10]: glm

Call:  glm(formula = log(Volume) ~ log(Height) + log(Girth), data = trees)

Coefficients:
(Intercept)  log(Height)   log(Girth)
     -6.632        1.117        1.983

Degrees of Freedom: 30 Total (i.e. Null);  28 Residual
Null Deviance:      8.309
Residual Deviance: 0.1855       AIC: -62.71
> tracemem(trees$Volume)
[1] "<0x895e230>"
>  lm(Volume~Height+Girth,data=trees)
memtrace[0x895e230->0x87a2898]: eval eval model.frame.default model.frame eval eval lm

Call:
lm(formula = Volume ~ Height + Girth, data = trees)

Coefficients:
(Intercept)       Height        Girth
   -57.9877       0.3393       4.7082
</pre>
 <code>tracemem</code> cannot be used on functions, since it uses the same trace bit that <code>trace</code> uses, and will not work on objects such as environments that are passed by reference and not duplicated. The output for this could be made prettier and sent to a file: the main thing to decide is how to handle files when multiple objects may be being traced.

<li> If R is compiled with <code>R_MEMORY_PROFILING</code> defined,
<code>Rprofmem</code> starts and stops a pure memory use profiler. A stack trace is sent to an output file on any large enough vector allocation (threshold set by the user) or when <code>GetNewPage</code> is called to expand the R heap. This profiler does not use timers and so can coexist with other forms of profiling. I do not yet have tools to summarize the output.

</ul>

Valgrind can also help with memory profiling at the C level, using <code>--tool=massif</code>
