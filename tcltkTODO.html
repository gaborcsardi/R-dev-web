<h1 align=center>TODO list for tcltk package</h1> 

<i>This site is intended as an intermediate repository for more or
less finalized ideas and plans for the R statistical system. Most
parts of the site are open to the public, and we welcome discussions
on the ideas, but please do not take them for more than that, in
particular there is no commitment to actually carry out the plans in
finite time unless expressedly stated.</i>

<h2>Language</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Tcl variables are global. It would be better to have a mechanism
where R creates a reference object to a unique Tcl variable. This
would effectively make the variables lexically scoped. 

<p> To do this properly and avoid memory leaks, there should be a
finalization mechanism to unset the Tcl variables when they go out of
scope. This should be possible to do using Luke's stuff.

<p> Some finesse is required to make
sure that the scope is alive as long as any widget is using the
variable, although this is hardly a big problem since there are few
cases where a variable is inaccessible, yet has a useful purpose. 
<p>

<li> Some types of variables are not easily handled, notably list
variables used by listboxes. 
<p>

<li> Some types of callbacks are difficult to generate. The most
important ones would seem to be those that contain a "break" in Tcl
and are used in event bindings to prevent execution of other bindings.
(Sorry, that was a bit obtuse. Specifically, if you bind something to
&lt;Ctrl-Return> it will trigger when you press Ctrl+Return, but so will
any binding for &lt;Return>, in particular the insertion of a linebreak
in a text widget.) 
</ul>

<h2>Event handling</h2>

The event loop issues needs to be looked at carefully. I suspect
we haven't quite understood the notifier structure, and the
consequences for the main loop on each platform. Some specific issues
are listed below:

<ul>
<li> The event loop is polling where it could have been event driven.
<p>
<li> Creating a standalone application (no command line) is tricky.
You can do it with 
tkwait.variable() but that seems wrong. There ought to be a way to
run the Tcl event loop without the ordinary input handler. In fact, it
is suspicious that tkwait.variable() works, because it indicates that
*something* is running an event loop of its own... 
<p><li> We need a clean way to take over the standard i/o channels,
preferably including the readline stuff, so as to Tk-ify the console.
<p><li> Some strange slowness occasionally, on Unix this hits when using
menu separators. (The tkcanvas demo was terribly slow on Windows --- 
still so?) 
<p><li> We may need to be more careful with  asynchronous event handling.
The separate thread on Windows seems to be interfering with some 
programming techniques. E.g. in Tcl you can generally set up the
text/scrollbar protocol with two widget commands even though they need
to refer to eachother, but in R/tcltk you need a configure step after
the widget creation. It might be useful to have a mechanism to disable
event handling while setup is in progress.
</ul>
