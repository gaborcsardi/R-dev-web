    <em>This site is intended as an intermediate repository for more
    or less finalized ideas and plans for the R statistical
    system. Most parts of the site is open to the public, and we
    welcome discussions on the ideas, but please do not take them for
    more than that, in particular no commitment to actually carry out
    the plans in finite time is implied unless expressedly stated. </em>

    For general information about R see <A
    href=http://cran.r-project.org>CRAN</a> and its mirror sites.

    Things to put into the site could be
    <ul>
      <li>todo lists</li>
      <li>RFCs</li>
      <li>various other writeups that might not be quite fit for
      general publication</li>
      <li>links to other websites (or copies of those that tend to
      disappear when you most need them, like Bill Metzenthen's
      floatingpoint pages...)</li>
      <li>current release plans and instructions</li>
      <li>CVS tips</li>
      <li>CVS logs (if I can figure out how to generate them...)</li>
    </ul>
