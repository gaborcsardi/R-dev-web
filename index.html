<h1>
R Developer Page</h1>
<i>This site is intended as an intermediate repository for more or less
finalized ideas and plans for the R statistical system. Most parts of the
site are open to the public, and we welcome discussions on the ideas, but
please do not take them for more than that, in particular there is no
commitment 
to actually carry out the plans in finite time unless expressedly stated.</i>

<p>For general information about R see <a
href="http://cran.r-project.org">CRAN</a> and its mirror sites.
