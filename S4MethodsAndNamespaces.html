<h1>Making "S4" Classes and Methods Work with Namespaces</h1>


Some notes on changes needed or desirable (and possible?) to integrate
the current (1.7.1) implementation of classes and methods with package
namespaces.

<h3>Classes</h3>

<ul>
  <li> The fundamental limitation currently is that
      <code>class(x)</code> returns a plain character string.  Code
      that needs to distinguish, say, the definition of a class in a
      particular namespace has nothing to go on.
<p>
      The proposed extension is to allow the class slot of an
      arbitrary object to contain
      something other than a plain character string.  If the class of
      the class slot extends "character", there is in fact nothing
      needed to <i>allow</i> the change, the problem is just to ensure
      that the extended class slot is preserved and used.
<p>
      Specifically, the notion is to have a class, say
      <code>"objectLocator"</code>, that adds to the name of an object
      some slots that identify where the object is located:
      <ul>
	<li> The name of the package;<p>
	<li> The environment from which to look for the object;<p>
	<li> Possible version information.
      </ul>
      (The second is desirable from an efficiency view, but raises
      issues about serializing/deserializing.  It would be important
      to NOT serialize the environment when saving the object with
      this class slot, and to try to access/re-create the environment,
      perhaps optionally, on deserializing it. Comments?)<p>
  <li> The essential to using extended class names is
      <code>getClass()</code>; this needs, in effect, to have methods
      for the relevant types of class slot.  Because
      <code>getClass()</code> will end up being central to everything,
      much of this will need to be coded internally for speed.
      <p>
      The current definition of <code>getClass()</code> uses a
      (global) table of stored class definitions.  That will be
      removed; a revised version of the methods package is currently
      (7/17/03) being tested that uses only class definitions stored
      in the corresponding package environments, no global tables.
      <p>
  <li> The function <code>new()</code> needs to be modified to use the
      environment of the calling function as the starting point in
      looking for the definition of a class specified as character
      string. (It will also take the extended forms of class locator
      objects as well; in practice, a suitable definition of
      <code>getClass()</code> may well do the right thing
      automatically, if <code>new()</code> passes down the calling
      environment as a default search environment.)
      <p>
  <li> When a class is defined by <code>setClass()</code>, the
      prototype object created will have a class slot "pointing" to
      the corresponding package (and environment?).  As a result,
      instances of the class created by <code>new()</code> should
      contain the appropriate class slot.
</ul>

Other class-based utilities will need to be modified to also allow the
appropriate version of a class to be used (e.g,. <code>is()</code> and
<code>as()</code>).
Details will be important, but the general picture seems similar to
that for <code>new()</code>:  provide the environment of the calling
function as the default, but with the possibility that the class
"name" will override in the call to <code>getClass()</code>.

<h3>Methods and Generic Functions</h3>

Conceptually, the requirement is that each relevant namespace or
global environment have a
suitable version of a particular generic function, corresponding to
the list of methods visible.

The basic point seems to be the following.  If <code>f</code> is a generic
function and package <code>P</code> defines methods for
<code>f</code>, then a call to <code>f</code> from a function in the
package sees the methods in <code>P</code> (including whatever <code>P</code> imports).
But if <code>f</code>
is visible globally, then a call to
<code>f</code> from the global environment sees only the methods that
are exported from the currently attached packages.
The methods in <code>P</code> may or not be exported.

The current dispatch mechanism is quite close to this model, except
for primitive functions.  These are a problem, in that dispatch is
done from C without any generic function being visible, so some
additional mechanism is needed.

Details:
<ul>
  <li> Forgetting primitives for the moment, the current dispatch
      mechanism stores the methods list for <code>f</code> in the
      environment of the generic function.  So long as the correct
      version of <code>f</code> is found, and so long as the methods
      list is computed correctly with respect to the environment of
      that function, the dispatch should work correctly.
      <p>
      The current implementation amortizes the cost of computing the
      methods lists by waiting until <code>f</code> is called to merge
      the visible methods.  There seems no obvious problem with
      retaining that strategy.
      <p>
  <li> The major modification needed is to create versions of the
      generic function in the necessary environments.  In the example
      above, <code>f</code> with the appropriate versions of its
      methods would have to exist (at least) in the namespace of <code>P</code>
      and in one of the environments on the search list so both calls
      to <code>f</code> would find the correct methods.
      <p>
      (Where on the search list?  I think in the environment of the
      first attached package that contains either the generic function
      or a <code>setMethod()</code> call for that function.  Included
      here is the notion that in S a non-generic definition of
      <code>f</code> is implicitly equivalent to a
      <code>setGeneric()</code> call and a specification of the
      default method.)
      <p>
  <li> The specification of a generic function in calls to
      <code>setMethod()</code> and <code>setGeneric()</code> should
      honor the extended object locator class(es) used for
      <code>getClass()</code>, to allow multiple generics of the same
      name on different packages.
      <p>
  <li> OK, now for primitive functions.  Here is the current picture.
      Dispatch for primitives starts from the existing
      internal C code to look for the corresponding function, checking
      for possible methods before evaluating the standard code.  There are three
      levels of checking, designed to be as efficient as possible in
      the case that methods do not apply to this call.
      <ol>
	<li> Does the argument (or either of the arguments, for
	    operators) have the object bit turned on? (Otherwise the
	    argument(s) are basic datatypes, for which the primitives
	    have fixed, default methods.)
	    <p>
	<li> Is S4 method dispatch on at all?
	    <p>
	<li> Has method dispatching been turned on for this particular function?
      </ol>
      If all checks pass, a method is selected for these arguments;
      selection may fail, in which case the default primitive code is
      used.
      <p>
      A global C table contains a flag for the third check and the
      corresponding methods list object, 
      indexed by the internal codes for the primitive functions.  (Strictly speaking
      this is not a global table, but a table that would belong to the
      "current evaluator", if the evaluator was an object.)
      <p>
  <li> To make dispatch work for these functions, effectively there
      must be "shadow" version of the corresponding generic function
      in each namespace/environment, as in the case of non-primitive
      functions.  The methods list defined there must be used instead
      of the current global methods list.
      <p>
      To maintain current efficiency for the non-methods calls to the
      primitives, it seems that the global table needs to be retained,
      but without containing the methods definitions themselves.  This
      implies that the three checks will pass if methods are defined
      for this primitive in <i>any</i> currently active package,
      whether the methods are exported or not.
      <p>
      The actual implementation of shadow versions of the generics, or
      of special methods list objects, appears feasible in a couple of
      different ways: the differences don't seem very important.
      The simplest mechanism seems to be hidden (e.g., name-mangled) generic function objects
      operating just like non-primitive generics, except that they are
      not the function objects visible when the primitive is called.
</ul>
