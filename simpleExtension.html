<h1>Simple Class Extensions</h1>

A class <code>C<sub>2</sub></code> is defined to be a simple extension of a
class <code>C<sub>1</sub></code> if the two classes are related by a simple
<code>setIs</code> call:
<code><pre>
  setIs(<code>C<sub>2</sub></code>, <code>C<sub>1</sub></code>)
</pre></code>
Simple extensions happen in two ways:<p>
<ol>
  <li> Implicitly, by <code>C<sub>1</sub></code> being included in the
      representation of <code>C<sub>2</sub></code>, in which case no
      explicit call to <code>setIs</code> is needed;<p>
  <li> Explicitly, by a call to <code>setIs</code>, in which case
      <code>C<sub>1</sub></code> must either be a virtual class or included
      in <code>C<sub>2</sub></code> (in the sense of both having the same
      definition for all the slots of <code>C<sub>1</sub></code>).
</ol>
<p>
In the current version of R (1.5.0 and later), simple extensions are
used in formal method dispatch without transforming the actual
argument.
That is, a method exists corresponding to class <code>C<sub>1</sub></code>
for some argument, and the actual argument has class
<code>C<sub>2</sub></code>, then the method can be selected.  If it is, the
method will be called with an untransformed argument (still class
<code>C<sub>2</sub></code>, not the defined class).
<p>
We are considering applying the same convention to slot assignments.
Suppose a slot is assigned, say
<code><pre>
  z&#64;type <- x
</pre></code>
If the slot was defined to have class <code>C<sub>1</sub></code> and
<code>x</code> has class <code>C<sub>2</sub></code>, the assignment would
succeed and <code>x</code> would be  stored in the slot, untransformed.
<p>
The same rule would apply to named arguments supplied to the function
<code>new</code>, assuming the class had no special
<code>initialize</code> method defined.
<p>
There are a few details to note:<p>
<ul>
  <li> Possibilities 1 and 2 are the <i>only</i> valid simple calls to
      <code>setIs</code>, because otherwise the two class
      representations conflict, so a <code>coerce=</code> argument
      must be supplied to <code>setIs</code>.<p>
  <li> Classes related by non-simple extensions are fine either for
      method dispatch or for slot assignment, but the supplied
      argument or slot value will be transformed to class <i>C<sub>1</sub></i>.<p>
  <li> The current API only requires that slot replacements be
      coercible to the target class, not that there be an extension.
      It's possible that this might be tightened if it seemed helpful
      in avoiding programming errors.
</ul>
