Updating packages for 1.6.0
===========================

Package maintainers should be aware of the following changes scheduled
to appear in 1.6.0.


There is a function vcov() in base (formerly in MASS).  Please provide
methods for it (and use it to replace any similar function in your
package).


Header Rversion.h is no longer included by R.h.  All the packages we
are aware of using it are conditionalizing pre-1.2.0 code, which
should now be removed and replaced by the line

Depends: R (>= 1.2.0)

in the DESCRIPTION file (or incorporating in existing dependencies).


duplicated() and unique() now have methods for matrices and arrays.
A few packages (e.g. PHYLOGR) called them on 1 x n matrices, and will
get a different result.  Usually the matrix was a mistake, but
as.vector() might be needed.
