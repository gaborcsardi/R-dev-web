<h1 align=center>TODO list for Windows version of R</h1> 

<i>This site is intended as an intermediate repository for more or
less finalized ideas and plans for the R statistical system. Most
parts of the site are open to the public, and we welcome discussions
on the ideas, but please do not take them for more than that, in
particular there is no commitment to actually carry out the plans in
finite time unless expressedly stated.</i>


<p>Many of the following plans are user requests, and may never be achieved.
<ul>
<li>Preferences editor, means to re-read configuration files to
console and devga devices. [DONE for 1.1.]

<li>A spreadsheet-like data editor in R, or a link to a suitable
external editor.

<li>Connections to external databases, ability to read/write Excel and
dBase files, ....

<li>Use separate threads for the R engine, graphics and overall
control (and thereby avoid polling for Windows events).
</ul>
