<h1 align=center>TODO list for Windows version of R</h1> 

<i>This site is intended as an intermediate repository for more or
less finalized ideas and plans for the R statistical system. Most
parts of the site are open to the public, and we welcome discussions
on the ideas, but please do not take them for more than that, in
particular there is no commitment to actually carry out the plans in
finite time unless expressedly stated.</i>

<h2>Enhancements</h2>

<p>There are currently no plans to make Windows-specific enhancements
to R.  R-core members feel that the aim of providing equivalent
functionality on Windows as on Unix/Linux has been achieved as well as
is practicable with the limited expertise available.

<p>There are many opportunities for contributions by Windows
programmers, including the lists below.


<h2>Bugs</h2>

A few things we know about, but do not know how to solve.
<ul>
<li>The enhanced metafiles produced by R do not work well in some
applications, including Word.  We suspect that in part the problem is in
Word's reader.

<li>There are a number of aspects of the toolkit (GraphApp) that are
not wholly satisfactory to experienced Windows users.
</ul>

<h2>User suggestions</h2>

<p>Suggestions include:
<ul>
<li>Connections to external databases, ability to read/write Excel and
dBase files, .... [package RODBC can do a lot of this.]

<li>Use separate threads for the R engine, graphics and overall
control (and thereby avoid polling for Windows events).

<li>Adding the ability to profile (function <tt>Rprof</tt>).

<li>The ability to write WMF on Unix. (This means vector WMF, not
the bitmaps that <tt>epstool</tt> and <tt>GSView</tt> make.)
</ul>
