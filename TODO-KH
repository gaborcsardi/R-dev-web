This file contains my plans for enhancements to R.
Kurt Hornik <Kurt.Hornik@R-project.org>

* Improve ctest.

  ** Correct 2-sided p-values for discrete tests such as binom.test.
     
  ** Implement modern-style permutation/simulation tests for at least
     the k-sample (oneway), independence and symmetry problems.

  ** Maybe introduce cbind() in formula interface to paired classical
     tests, so that e.g.

	t.test(cbind(x, y) ~ 1, data = FOOBAR)

     works.  Not clear if we really want this: what about more general
     contrasts?

  ** More exact p-values, in particular for the Kolmogorov-Smirnov
     tests.

  ** More goodness-of-fit tests (chisq.gof?, Anderson-Darling, ...).

  ** General (simple linear) rank tests with a unified interface (and
     some particular cases such as 'normal scores'), functionality
     similar to SAS proc npar1way for the oneway case.  In addition,
     there should be tests for independence and symmetry.

  ** Stratified rank sum tests.  Already have code for Kruskal-Wallis,
     but maybe we should do this in general.

* Improve functionality for categorical data analysis.
				
  ** Allow conditioning in the formula interfaces for fourfoldplot
     (e.g., fourfoldplot(~ Admit + Gender | Dept, data =
     UCBAdmissions).)

  ** Extend mosaicplot.

     *** Allow conditioning in the formula interface.

     *** Generalize extended mosaic plots to plot frequencies from a
         table in array form with shading/filling determined from a
         similar array (of the same dimensions, e.g. the residuals of a
         loglinear model).

     *** Need to improve color defaults and layout (e.g., variable names
         are only shown for the first horizontal and vertical splits).

     *** It should be possible to color by any variable and not
         necessarily the last one.

  ** ftable() is nice, but we need a bit more.  Rethink whether we need
     something like F Harrell's summary.formula(), although most likely
     the best approach would be to output this in XML/SGML and go on
     from there, rather than dealing with LaTeX and HTML etc ourselves.

* Miscellaneous

  ** Add wrapper functions such as Pairs() and Binom().  This should
     also improve the interfaces to classical testing, e.g.

	wilcox.test(Pairs(x, y) ~ 1)	# paired tests
	prop.test(Binom(x, n))		# comparing proportions

  ** Some of the macros in R.m4 could be made available to configure
     scripts for add-on packages.
