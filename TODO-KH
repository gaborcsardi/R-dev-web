				Dear Emacs, make this -*-Text-*- mode!

This file contains my plans for enhancements to R.
Kurt Hornik <Kurt.Hornik@r-project.org>

* Eliminate system.file().
									[DONE]
    
* Improve R documentation system

  ** Rewrite codoc as follows.  Only use Perl to extract the synopsis or
     usage sections and get rid of Rd markup, such as \dots or \%, (or
     \method{GENERIC}{CLASS} in future versions), or the <<see below>>
     argument value style.  Write this to a file and use R to parse
     this, and set up the function arglists etc from this.  (Should also
     make it possible to deal with assignments.)

  ** Use fuzzy matching in help.search().  MM suggests using agrep,
     which should come along with Glimpse (http://webglimpse.org/).
     Another idea is to use the functionality (C code) in the Perl
     String::Approx module
     (http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=String-Approx).

     Also, help.search() should really use database in a format it can
     read in quickly, e.g. using scan(), rather than DCF.  Could be
     called e.g. `CONTENTS.db', and require a change in Rd2contents.

  ** Rd extensions, in particular index entries a la
	\index{NAME}{TEXT}
     (so that `complete' INDEX files can be built from the Rd files),
     and documentation categories (topics; objects-funs-vars; classes
     and methods, ...) with different templates.

  ** Enforce `documentation object' view.

* Improve demos

  [See also KH-RFC-demos.]

  ** Have package-specific demos as R code files (see below) in subdir
     `inst/demos' in the package source tree.
									[DONE]
     
  ** Extend demo() argument list to
        demo(topic, package = .packages(), lib.loc = .lib.loc, ...)
									[DONE]
	    
* ctest

  ** More exact p-values, in particular for the Kolmogorov-Smirnov
     tests.

  ** More goodness-of-fit tests (chisq.gof?, Anderson-Darling, ...).

  ** General (simple linear) rank tests with a unified interface (and
     some particular cases such as `normal scores'), functionality
     similar to SAS proc npar1way for the oneway case.  In addition,
     there should be tests for independence and symmetry.

  ** Stratified rank sum tests.  Already have code for Kruskal-Wallis,
     but maybe we should do this in general (and again, maybe have the
     unified interface first).

  ** More general 2-sided p-values for discrete tests.  We have some
     suggestions and test code by Simon Fear.
     
* Improve functionality for categorical data analysis.

  ** ftable() is nice, but we need a bit more.  Rethink whether we need
     something like F Harrell's summary.formula(), although most likely
     the best approach would be to output this in XML/SGML and go on
     from there, rather than dealing with LaTeX and HTML etc ourselves.

* mva

  ** cmdscale() is not fully compatible with the prototype as it has no
     `add' argument.  Can anyone fix this?  (Most likely not me ...) 

  ** What other stuff is missing?

     Clustering: plclust subtree
     Graphics: stars

     But who can do that?

* ``Missing functionality''

  Provide a list of things in the Blue or White Books (and maybe in
  S-Plus) along with information about possible replacements in R.
