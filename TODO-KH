				Dear Emacs, make this -*-Text-*- mode!

This file contains some of my plans for enhancements to R.
Kurt Hornik <Kurt.Hornik@R-project.org>

* Improve classical tests.

  ** Correct 2-sided p-values for discrete tests such as binom.test.
     
  ** More exact p-values, in particular for the Kolmogorov-Smirnov
     tests.

  ** More goodness-of-fit tests (chisq.gof?, Anderson-Darling, ...).

  ** Add inference for proportions based on hypergeometric sampling.

* Implement use() as a standard evaluation replacement for loading
  packages via library() and/or require().

* Enhance tools for computing on repositories (of source or binary
  packages).

* Maybe write a unified front-end to R package management, code-named
  rpm(), modelled e.g. after Debian's aptitude or synaptic (command line
  versions).  

* Maybe write an Rd parser (and converter?) in R.
