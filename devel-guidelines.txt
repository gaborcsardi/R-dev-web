DEVELOPMENT GUIDELINES
======================


Where to commit:
----------------

Every now and then, the discussion comes up about what can go in the
patch branch (i.e. x.y.z with z >= 1). Here's a preliminary set of
guidelines:

DO fix simple bugs
DO NOT fix bugs that require extensive modification
DO NOT fix exotic bugs that haven't bugged anyone
DO make small enhancements if they are badly needed
DO NOT let one user decide what is badly needed
DO fix configuration for broken platforms
DO NOT break functioning platforms in the process

DO NOT fix things that are not broken
DO NOT restructure code
DO NOT add experimental code
DO NOT modify the API (unless absolutely sure it is buggy)

DO clarify documentation
DO NOT add or modify examples (unless essential to clarification)
DO NOT modify regression tests

---

For the "trunk" i.e. what becomes x.y.0 releases only one rule seems
necessary:

DO NOT add code that cannot become reasonably complete by the next release.

---

[Obviously none of the above rules are carved in stone, and all are
subject to interpretation in actual cases.]
