DEVELOPMENT GUIDELINES
======================


Where to commit:
----------------

Every now and then, the discussion comes up about what can go in the
r-patched (i.e. x.y.z with z >= 1). Here's a preliminary set of
guidelines:

DO fix simple bugs
DO NOT fix bugs that require extensive modification
DO NOT fix exotic bugs that haven't bugged anyone
DO make small enhancements if they are badly needed
DO NOT let one user decide what is badly needed
DO fix configuration for broken platforms
DO NOT break functioning platforms in the process

DO NOT fix things that are not broken
DO NOT restructure code
DO NOT add experimental code
DO NOT modify the API (unless absolutely sure it is buggy)
DO NOT change defaults without a *very* good reason

DO clarify documentation
DO NOT add or modify examples (unless essential to clarification)
DO NOT modify regression tests

---

For r-devel i.e. what becomes x.y.0 releases only one rule seems
necessary:

DO NOT add code that cannot become reasonably complete by the next release.

---

For r-ng, the rules are that there are no rules (beyond common
sense) 


[Obviously none of the above rules are carved in stone, and all are
subject to interpretation in actual cases.]


Removing functions:
-------------------

Making a function/feature defunct MUST happen at a minor (x.y.0) release.
Deprecation CAN happen for a branch release.
Deprecation MUST precede making something defunct.

See ?Deprecated and ?Defunct for the practical mechanisms


Detailed release schedule for 1.6.0:
------------------------------------

August 27: 

    Declare start of release process. Setup so that we can easily
    build and make check on base and all recommended packages.

    There is a "grand feature" freeze (minor tweaks can be applied,
    but no wholesale restructuring or API changes). 

    We coordinate with package maintainers to allow them to adapt to any
    changes in base. 


September 10:

    Feature freeze, simultaneously on base and recommended packages.
    It is assumed that all recommende packages pass their checks at
    this point. The API should not be touched.
    
    Start making R-1.6.0beta.tgz packages automatically available and
    encourage people to do test builds. 


September 24:

    Code freeze. Only critical and/or trivial bugs fixed from this
    time onwards. Configure/make should only be touched in
    emergencies. 


October 1:

    Release.
