## Historical relict: R `matrix` is not an `array`

In a recent discussion on the `R-devel` mailing list, in a thread started on July 8,
[head.matrix can return 1000s of columns -- limit to n or add new argument?](https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-devel/2019-July/078143.html)
Michael Chirico and then Gabe Becker where proposing to generalize the `head()` and `tail()` utility functions, and Gabe noted that current (pre R-4.x.y) [`head()` would not treat `array`
specially](https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-devel/2019-October/078606.html).
[I've replied, noting](https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-devel/2019-October/078610.html)
that R currently typically needs both a `matrix` and an `array` method:

> Note however the following  historical quirk :

```{r array-matrix-aint, eval=FALSE}
sapply(setNames(,1:5),
       function(K) inherits(array(7, dim=1:K), "array"))
```

((As I hope this will change, I explicitely put the current R 3.x.y result rather than evaluating the above R chunk: ))

```
     1     2     3     4     5
  TRUE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE
```

Note that `matrix` objects are not `array` s in that (inheritance) sense,
even though --- many useRs may not be aware of ---
```{r array-makes-matrix}
identical(
    matrix(47, 2,3), # NB  " n, n+1 " is slightly special
    array (47, 2:3))
```
all matrices can equivalently constructed by `array(.)` though slightly more clumsily in the case of `matrix(*, byrow=TRUE)`.

Note that because of that, base R itself has three functions where the `matrix` and the `array` methods are identical, as I wrote in the post:
_The consequence of that is that currently, "often"  `foo.matrix` is just a copy of `foo.array`
 in the case the latter exists, with `base` examples of foo in {unique, duplicated, anyDuplicated} ._

```{r matrix-array-identical}
for(e in expression(unique, duplicated, anyDuplicated)) { # `e` is a `symbol`
    f.m <- get(paste(e, "matrix", sep="."))
    f.a <- get(paste(e, "array",  sep="."))
    stopifnot(is.function(f.m),
              identical(f.m, f.a))
}
```

## In R 4.0.0, will a `matrix()` be an `"array"`?

In that same post, I've also asked

> Is this something we should consider changing for R 4.0.0 -- to
>  have it TRUE also for 2d-arrays aka matrix objects ??

In the mean time, I've tentatively answered _"yes"_ to my own question, and started investigating some
of the consequences.
From what I found, in too eager (unit) tests, some even written by myself, I was reminded that I had wanted to teach more people about an underlying related issue where we've seen many unsafe useR's use R unsafely:

<!--  any chance to have a two-line title with explicit line break where I want it  ??? -->
## If you think `class(.) == *`, think again: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rather   `inherits(., *)`  ....  or  `is(., *)`

Most non-beginning R users are aware of __inheritance__ between classes,
and even more generally that R objects, at least conceptually, are of more than one "kind".
E.g, `pi` is both `"numeric"` and `"double"` or `1:2` is both `integer` and `numeric`.
They may know that time-date objects come in two forms:  The [`?DateTimeClasses`
(or `?POSIXt`) help page](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/DateTimeClasses.html)
describes `POSIXct` and `POSIXlt` and says

>	`"POSIXct"` is more convenient for including in data frames, and
>	`"POSIXlt"` is closer to human-readable forms.  A virtual class
>	`"POSIXt"` exists from which both of the classes inherit ...

and for example
```{r Sys.time-2-classes}
(tm <- Sys.time())
class(tm)
```
shows that `class(.)` is of length two here, something breaking a `if(class(x) == "....") ..` call.


### Formal Classes: `S4`

R's _formal_ class system, called _`S4`_ (implemented mainly in the standard R package `methods`)
provides functionality and tools to implement rich class inheritance structures, made use of heavily
in [package `Matrix`](https://cran.R-project.org/package=Matrix),
or in the [Bioconductor project](https://bioconductor.org) with it's 1800+ R "software" packages.
Bioconductor even builds on core packages providing much used S4 classes, e.g.,
[Biostrings](https://bioconductor.org/packages/Biostrings/),
[S4Vectors](https://bioconductor.org/packages/S4Vectors/),
[XVector](https://bioconductor.org/packages/XVector/),
[IRanges](https://bioconductor.org/packages/IRanges/),
and
[GenomicRanges](https://bioconductor.org/packages/GenomicRanges/).
See also
[Common Bioconductor Methods and Classes](https://bioconductor.org/developers/how-to/commonMethodsAndClasses/).

Within the formal S4 class system, where extension and inheritance are important and often widely used,
an expression such as
```{r call-eq-1, eval=FALSE}
if (class(obj) == "matrix")  { ..... }   # *bad* - do not copy !
```
is particularly unuseful, as `obj` could well be of a class that _extends_ matrix, and S4 using
programmeRs learn early to rather use
```{r rather-is-1, eval=FALSE}
if (is(obj, "matrix"))  { ..... }        # *good* !!!
```

Note that the Bioconductor guidelines for package developers have warned about the misuse of `class(.) == *`
<!-- for how long ?? -->, see the section
[R Code and Best Practices](https://bioconductor.org/developers/package-guidelines/#rcode)


### Informal "Classical" Classes: `S3`

R was created as _dialect_ or implementation of S,
see [Wikipedia's R History](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)#History),
and for S, the _"White Book"_ (Chambers & Hastie, 1992) introduced a convenient relatively simple
object orientation (OO), later coined _`S3`_ because the white book introduced _S version 3_ (where the blue book described _S version 2_, and the green book _S version 4_, i.e., `S4`).

The white book also introduced formulas, data frames, etc, and in some cases also the idea that some S objects
could be _particular_ cases of a given class, and in that sense _extend_ that class.
Examples, in R, too, have been multivariate time series (`"mts"`) extending (simple) time series (`"ts"`),
or multivariate or generalized linear models (`"mlm"` or `"glm"`) extending normal linear models `"lm"`.

### The "Workaround":  `class(.)[1]`

So, some more experienced and careful programmers have been replacing `class(x)` by `class(x)[1]` 
(or `class(x)[1L]`) in such comparisons, e.g., in a good and widely lauded useR! 2018 talk.  
In some cases, this is good enough, and it is also what R's `data.class(.)` function does (among other), or the 
(user hidden)  `methods:::.class1(.)`.

However, programmeRs should be aware that this is just a workaround and leads to their working _incorrectly_
in cases where typical S3 inheritance is used:  In some situtation it is very natural to slightly modify
or extend a function `fitme()` whose result is of class `"fitme"`, typically by writing 
`fitmeMore()`, say, whose value would be of class `c("fMore", "fitme")` such that almost all "fitme" methods 
would continue to work, but the author of `fitmeMore()` would additionally provide a `print()` method, i.e.,
provide method function `print.fMore()`. 

*But* if other users work with `class(.)[1]` and have provided code for the case
`class(.)[1] == "fitme"` that code would *wrongly* not apply to the new `"fMore"` objects.  
The only correct solution is to work with `inherits(., "fitme")` as that would apply to all 
objects it should.

In a much depended on CRAN package, the following line (slightly obfuscated)
which should efficiently determine list entries of a certain class
```{r vapply-class, eval=FALSE}
isC <- vapply(args, class, "") == "__my_class__"
```
was found (and notified to the package maintainer) to need correction to

```{r vapply-inherits, eval=FALSE}
isC <- vapply(args, inherits, TRUE, what = "__my_class__")
```

### Summary:

**Instead  `class(x) == "foo"`, you should use `inherits(x, "foo")`  
  &nbsp; &nbsp; 
  or maybe alternatively  `is(x, "foo")`**
  
#### Corollary: 
```{r switch-class-1, eval=FALSE}
switch(class(x)[1],
       "class_1" = { ..... },
       "class_2" = { ..... },
       .......,
       .......,
       "class_10" = { ..... },
       stop(" ... invalid class:", class(x)))
```
may look clean, but is is almost always *not good enough*, as it is (typically) wrong, 
e.g., when `class(x)` is `c("class_7", "class_2")`.
