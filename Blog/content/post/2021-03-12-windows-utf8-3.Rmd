A new, experimental, build of R for Windows is available, its main aim being
to support the UTF-8 encoding and especially non-European languages.  Check
results for CRAN packages are now available on their CRAN results pages. 
Please help by reviewing these for your package(s) and if a Windows user by
trying the new build, particularly if you use a language written in a
non-Latin script.

The new build can be downloaded from [[2]](https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/winutf8/ucrt3/)
and instructions are at 
[[1]](https://svn.r-project.org/R-dev-web/trunk/WindowsBuilds/winutf8/ucrt3/howto.html). 
The intention is to run the new and old builds in parallel at least until R
4.2.0 is released in 2022. A check service for package maintainers is
planned.

describe some technical aspects of UTF-8 on Windows.

## Whats new

There are regular experimental builds of a new toolchain based on UCRT,
libraries for R packages, R-devel and CRAN R binary packages. There is a new
CRAN package check 
[flavor](https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_flavors.html#r-devel-windows-x86_64-gcc10-UCRT)
`r-devel-windows-x86_64-gcc10-UCRT`.

From the current [CRAN
statistics](https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_summary.html),
nearly 98\% of CRAN packages seem to be working (result in `OK` or `NOTE`),
compared to 99\% working with `r-devel-windows-ix86+x86_64`. 

About 380 packages are still to be fixed.  Only some of them may need direct
fixing, most will be blocked by their dependencies, but still this may
require a lot of work.  Moreover, the automated testing so far has been done
in Latin 1 locale and additional issues may be found when running in UTF-8.

## How R users may help

The key reason for this effort is to support R Windows users of languages
not based on the Latin script.  Users from Asia often run into problems when
they try to process texts on systems in Europe or North America. They may
still switch the locale, but that is often inconvenient or restricted.

There is no workaround for people working with texts in multiple languages
based on non-Latin scripts at the same time.  One cannot say process names
of people both from Japan and India at all, because no Windows locale
supports all needed languages.

Users of languages not based on the Latin script are also the key people who
could help with testing.  They may install this experimental version of R
and try analyzing some texts in their languages.  It is likely that there
will be a number of errors, both in R and in external software not
compatible with UTF-8 encoding.  One know problem currently is cursor
movements in RTerm and RGui, but there will be more.

Many of such errors cannot be found by the current automated testing,
because that testing does not involve such texts: the tests have been
designed for the current version of R.  Similarly, these are errors that
would not be found by the currently active R developers, who are not users
of those languages.

Discovered issues may be reported to [R-devel mailing
list](https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-devel) or directly to the
author. Any report should come with a minimal reproducible example, with
minimal data, ideally with non-ASCII characters expressed using `\u` or `\U`
escapes for ease of debugging, otherwise following the [general
advice](https://www.r-project.org/bugs.html) on reporting bugs in R.

## Automation

To allow regular checking, the build of the toolchain, libraries, R
installer and R binary packages is automated.  Products of these builds
are available
[[2]](https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/winutf8/ucrt3) for download and check results are
available on CRAN pages (see e.g. 
[tiff](https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_tiff.html)). See 
[[4]](https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/winutf8/ucrt3/CRAN/checks/gcc10-UCRT/README.txt)
for more information about the individual components of the build and their
versioning.

Scripts
[[3]](https://svn.r-project.org/R-dev-web/trunk/WindowsBuilds/winutf8/ucrt3)
automating the builds and checks are run several times a week.  All
components are subject to change due to rebuilds and ongoing work.  Unlike
some other CRAN checks, currently all packages are rebuilt, reinstalled and
rechecked on each run.

The toolchain and libraries are built on Linux using a customized version of
MXE (cross-compiled), optionally in a Docker container.

R and R installers are built on Windows natively using the toolchain and
libraries.  This can be also optionally done in a Docker container,
including automated installation of the necessary dependencies into a clean
Windows virtual machine.  This script can be also used to set up quickly a
virtual machine for manual experimentation/debugging of packages.

R binary packages are built natively on Windows.  However, note that Windows
Docker containers can only be run on a Windows host machine.

Checking of R packages uses the installer and binary R packages built
automatically in the previous steps, so the same ones as built and
distributed for end users/testers.

## R Updates

Two related installer changes were made upstream in R-devel.  The R
installer is normally built for both 32-bit and 64-bit architectures, but
now it can also be built for only one.  Before, the 64-bit-only installer
was not supported at all and the 32-bit-only was broken.  This experimental
toolchain only supports 64-bit architecture. Support for 32-bit architecture
is not planned.

The R installer can now be used for per-user installation without
administrative permissions.  Such installation can be run from the command
line, so this is suitable for automated testing.

The remaining changes are only in the patched experimental version of R. 
Some of them may be ported later, some are only for experimentation.
 
Binary packages built for UCRT are flagged as such in their DESCRIPTION file
and R will refuse to install binary packages with native code (a.k.a
"needing compilation") without this flag.  This prevents installation of
incompatible packages into this experimental version of R.  The opposite is
not true, if someone tried to re-use a package installed by the UCRT build
of R-devel in a normal build of R-devel, it would not work, such packages
will probably fail in unexpected ways.

R is patched to download binary packages preferentially from a pre-set
location under [[2]](https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/winutf8/ucrt3/).  This
location has binary builds of CRAN packages that need compilation.  It has
also several BIOC dependencies.  However, other binary packages (e.g.  those
that don't need compilation) and source packages are downloaded from
standard CRAN locations.

This experimental feature works well when packages are available and up to
date.  In other cases the user may be offered to install a package from the
official CRAN repository, but that installation will then fail with an error
message that the package is not built for UCRT, or a package will fail to
build due to an outdated patch for UCRT.  One may specify `type="binary"` or
`type="source"` to solve this when the package supports UCRT (see
`?install.packages` for details on how these modes of installation work).

To make it easier also to install packages from source, patches to R
packages are applied automatically by this version of R at package
installation time, which is also when binary packages are built.  This
automated patching is only intended as a temporary measure before package
maintainers update their packages.

The source packages are intact, but based on the package name, R will check
a repository of patches and apply a patch if available.  This is clearly
marked in installation output, in binary package meta-data, and the patch is
also included in the binary build of the package.  It can be turned off.

With this feature, users may easily install more source packages "as usual". 
The repository of patches is under
[[2]](https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/winutf8/ucrt3/patches) and the master copy is
versioned
[[3]](https://svn.r-project.org/R-dev-web/trunk/WindowsBuilds/winutf8/ucrt3/r_packages/patches/).

R now understands `.ucrt` suffix of `Makevars` and `Makefile` files.  In
this UCRT build, these files are used in preference of files with suffix
`.win`.  The original version of R ignores `.ucrt` files, so they can be
already used in the upstream packages to implement customizations needed for
UCRT.

The patches in the patch repository mostly just add these `Makevars.ucrt`
files (customized versions of `Makevars.win`), only several packages
required code changes so far.  Package authors are welcome to re-use these
patches in their code if they wish to support UCRT.

## Coverage and how package maintainers may help

The coverage of R packages has been improved since the previous iteration
([July 2020](../../../../2020/07/30/windows/utf-8-build-of-r-and-cran-packages/index.html))
via more patches to R packages, via more external libraries provided with
the toolchain, hence more MXE packages, and via building an external
application, [JAGS](https://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.io/), with this new
toolchain.

Instructions
[[1]](https://svn.r-project.org/R-dev-web/trunk/WindowsBuilds/winutf8/ucrt3/howto.html)
and downloads are available for package authors to experiment with this
toolchain and debug their packages. This requires Windows, ideally Windows
10. [Free Windows 10 machines for testing](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/vms/) (though-time
limited) are available from Microsoft and  can be used on Linux, Mac and Windows
in VirtualBox and other virtualization software.


There is a number of things package authors could do if they want their
packages to be supported.  First, package authors may review package
patches, improve and incorporate them into their code, and ask for them to
be removed from the central repository.

Then, several current CRAN packages require external libraries not yet
provided by the toolchain.  Package authors may help by adding support for
these external libraries via providing MXE packages (build configurations). 
Ideally this support would be contributed to upstream MXE, but tested also
with the modified version of MXE used to build this toolchain and libraries. 
This would reduce the maintenance costs and allow more people to benefit
from the work.  See
[[1]](https://svn.r-project.org/R-dev-web/trunk/WindowsBuilds/winutf8/ucrt3/howto.html)
for more.

The same applies to when R packages use an external application in a way
that requires that application to be rebuilt for UCRT using this toolchain. 
Ideally, support to do that will be contributed upstream to those
applications, to reduce maintenance costs and increase the general benefit
for open-source community.  It can be expected such additions would be
welcome as it is unlikely that open-source software for Windows built using
free compilers could keep using MSVCRT forever.

## Limitations

Supporting UTF-8 on Windows via UCRT seems to be the only feasible way, as
discussed in the [May 2020](../../../../2020/05/02/utf-8-support-on-windows/index.html)
post. Still, there are some limitations.

To reliably use UTF-8 as native encoding in R, both the Windows system
encoding ("Active Code Page") and the C runtime encoding have to be UTF-8. 
The use of UTF-8 as the system encoding can only be set at application build
time.  This means that when R is embedded (linked as a DLL) into another
application, that application would have to set UTF-8 as the system
encoding.  This is possible, indeed RGui and RTerm do it in the experimental
build, but not all applications embedding R may be ready for UTF-8 as the
system encoding.  Depending on how these applications decided to provide
encoding support on Windows, they may have to be re-designed.

When UTF-8 cannot be used as the system encoding, the experimental build of
R would still run as the normal R does now with the locale encoding on
Windows.  This happens also on older Windows systems, including Windows
Server 2016 and earlier, which do not allow setting UTF-8 as the system
encoding and will ignore such request.  This is why the CRAN checks are
still running with Latin 1 encoding.

When R packages are linked against external DLLs, such as R package runjags
which links to JAGS DLL, there are inverse problems to embedding R. 
Depending on how the external DLL implements encoding support, this may or
may not work with UTF-8 being the system encoding.  It would not work for
applications built for MSVCRT and using also the `-A` Windows API calls, such
as the current R, and this is also why all R packages have to be rebuilt
with the new toolchain.

Then there are other issues with using multiple C runtimes in the same
application.  For example, C runtimes implement their own heaps, and hence
one must free dynamically allocated objects by the same runtime that
allocated them, so to be safe by the same DLL.  This restriction is not so
intrusive for plain C, but complicates the use of C++, where typically some
allocation/deallocation is in code inlined via the header files, while other
is in the DLL.  In the case of JAGS, this was solved by
rebuilding JAGS using this toolchain for UCRT
[[1]](https://svn.r-project.org/R-dev-web/trunk/WindowsBuilds/winutf8/ucrt3/howto.html),
and it might often be the most straightforward solution.
