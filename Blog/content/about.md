This blog site is for R developers to share their experience, ideas and
plans related to R core implementation.  Technical details presented here
might be useful for package developers and interesting for
technically-minded R enthusiasts.

Although blog posts on this site are by members of RCore or RFoundation,
unless stated otherwise they represent individual opinions or plans of the
authors.  The posts do not represent decisions for RCore/RFoundation as a
group.

To ensure technical quality of the posts, authors can modify the posts after
publication.

The website is generated using the
[**blogdown**](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) package and
[**Hugo**](https://gohugo.io).  The theme is based on
[@jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme](https://github.com/jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme)
and modifications by [Yihui Xie](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-lithium-theme).  More features are
expected once there are some real blog posts on the site.
