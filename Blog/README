To add a blog post and rebuild the site (all content is static):

1.  checkout svn from https://svn.r-project.org/R-dev-web/trunk

    (it helps to do this in a clean installation that does not have any more
     packages than needed for the blogs to build, because some blogs include
     R code which may be affected by extra packages, such as new conflicts
     between names exported from different packages)

2.  the blog is under "Blog"

3.  get a recent version of R-devel to build the blog (some posts
    demonstrate new R-devel features, so one needs an R version with the
    features to build the .Rmd files)

4.  install blogdown package

    install.packages("blogdown")

    blogdown uses "hugo" and provides functionality to install hugo (gives
    some R command to run the installation), but one can also install hugo
    manually on the local machine - on Ubuntu or Debian, it is "apt-get
    install hugo".

    hugo must not be too old (Ubuntu 18.04 has hugo 0.40 and it works fine,
    hugo 0.16 from Ubuntu 16.04 fails with "Error: unknown flag: --themesDir"

5.  install these packages (needed to build existing blog posts):
        dplyr, MASS, colorspace

      [ please update this list for any new dependencies ]

6.  run svn update

    it may help to delete unneeded local files, so that you only have what
    is in the svn and in the current version (because many new files will
    then be generated and one needs to add them, without accidentally adding
    files not intended for commit)

7.  go to directory Blog, run "blogdown::build_site()" and check whether it
    finished without errors, rebuilding all blog posts; if not, go back to
    previous steps and try to fix the problem; when it is ok

8.  run "blogdown::serve_site()", this will open a web browser and display
    the current version of the blog from the SVN working copy, so even local
    uncommitted changes; this local view gets automatically updated when you
    edit your blog post (Rmd file)

9.  in another terminal window, go to "content/post" (to create a new post)

    start from copy of an existing post, e.g.  a copy of something like
    2018-03-23-dll-limit.Rmd, edit the meta data at the top of the Rmd file
    and edit the content; when one saves the file, hugo automatically
    rebuilds the blog _locally_ and the changes become visible in the local
    web browser (nothing is committed automatically)

10. when happy with the changes/new post, quit the R session running
    "serve_site()", re-start R, run "blogdown::build_site()"; that will take
    several seconds and rebuild all the blog posts

11.  "svn add" newly created files and directories for the blog (in addition
    to the Rmd files, these will include a html version, rendered images,
    meta-data for categories and tags, etc)

12. svn commit

    an updated version of the blog will appear eventually (when the website
    gets auto-updated) at

    https://developer.r-project.org/Blog/public/index.html
