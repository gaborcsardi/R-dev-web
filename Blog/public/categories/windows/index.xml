      <description>Sometimes it is useful to test R on unusual platforms, even when the expected number of users is not large at the moment. It is better to be ready when a new platform arrives or becomes more widely used, it may be easier to find some bugs on one platform than other, and such testing may reveal code unintentionally too platform specific.
Recently I wanted to test R on 64-bit ARM (Aarch64) and on Power.</description>

      <description>R internally allows strings to be represented in the current native encoding, in UTF-8 and in Latin 1. When interacting with the operating system or external libraries, all these representations have to be converted to native encoding. On Linux and macOS today this is not a problem, because the native encoding is UTF-8, so all Unicode characters are supported. On Windows, the native encoding cannot be UTF-8 nor any other that could represent all Unicode characters.</description>
