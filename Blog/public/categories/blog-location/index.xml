      <description>The R blog moves to https://blog.r-project.org, a more prominent location, after 37 blog posts (some of them perhaps surprisingly detailed) and a bit over 4 years. Please update your bookmarks and RSS readers to use the new location.
This blog site has been started under https://developer.r-project.org in March 2018 as a new communication channel for R developers contributing to the R core implementation. Most of the blog posts cover selected changes in R-devel, the development version of R.</description>
