      <title>S3 Method Lookup</title>

      <description>At the core of the S3 object system as introduced in the White Book lies the idea that (S3) methods are ordinary functions that follow the GEN.CLS naming convention (with GEN.default as a final fallback). In the initial R implementation of this object system, these methods were searched for in the environment (and all enclosing environments) from which the generic was called.
With the advent of namespaces (see Tierney (2003), “Name space management for R”, R News, 3(1):2-6) a mechanism for registering S3 methods via S3method() directives in the NAMESPACE file of a package was added.</description>

      <title>Common PROTECT Errors</title>

      <description>This post presents the most common PROTECT bugs present in packages, based on manual inspection of ~100 remaining CRAN packages with reports from rchk.
Background Any C/C++ code interacting with R, both inside R itself and in packages, needs to inform the garbage collector about which objects on the R heap are reachable from local variables. Pointers to such objects are kept on the pointer protection stack or the precious list or multi-set, but the most common is the pointer protection stack with PROTECT/UNPROTECT macros.</description>

      <title>Use of C&#43;&#43; in Packages</title>

      <description>About 20% packages from CRAN and BIOC repositories include some native code and more than a half of those include some code in C++. This number is rather high given that the R API and runtime have been designed for C (or Fortran) and cannot be used reliably from C++, without extensive effort and restrictions. To avoid nasty bugs in such code, one needs to know R internals well, and when following the restrictions, one cannot use much from C++ anyway.</description>

      <title>Parser Speedups</title>

      <description>It wasn’t my primary goal to improve parser performance nor to measure it. I’ve been working on optimizations to reduce the runtime overhead of including source reference into packages (this is not done by default due to space and execution time overheads). I’ve added an option to exclude parse data from source references and enabled it by default for packages, as parse data account for most of the runtime overhead of source references while they are rarely needed.</description>

      <title>Unprotecting by Value</title>
      <link>/Blog/public/2018/12/10/unprotecting-by-value/</link>

      <description>In short, UNPROTECT_PTR is dangerous and should not be used. This text describes why and describes how to replace it, including mset-based functions that have been introduced as a substitute for situations when unprotection by value is really needed. This could be of interest to anyone who writes native code to interface with the R heap, and definitely to all who use UNPROTECT_PTR in their code.
Background R provides several functions to protect pointers to R objects held by local C variables (typed SEXP) from the garbage collector.</description>

      <title>Conditions of Length Greater Than One</title>
      <link>/Blog/public/2018/10/12/conditions-of-length-greater-than-one/</link>

      <guid>/Blog/public/2018/10/12/conditions-of-length-greater-than-one/</guid>
      <description>Historically R language allows conditions in if and while statements to be vectors (of length greater than one). The first element is used but the remaining elements are ignored, since November 2002 also with a warning (added by Brian Ripley). Following an intuition that such situations would typically arise from a programming error, an option has been added in March 2017 to optionally allow signalling a runtime error, instead (the patch was by Martin Maechler, pinged by a suggestion of Henrik Bengtsson on the R-devel mailing list).</description>

      <title>Maximum Number of DLLs</title>
      <link>/Blog/public/2018/03/23/maximum-number-of-dlls/</link>

      <guid>/Blog/public/2018/03/23/maximum-number-of-dlls/</guid>
      <description>Some packages contain native code, which is linked to R dynamically in the form of dynamically loaded libraries (DLLs). Recently, R users started loading increasing numbers of packages; “workflow documents” are one source of this pattern. This has eventually lead to hitting the DLL limit in R, which materializes as runtime error “maximal number of DLLs reached”.
Limit on the number of open files The DLL limit in R is good for one important reason.</description>
