      <description>Recent version of the GNU Fortran compiler (7, 8, 9) include optimizations that break interoperability between C and Fortran code with BLAS/LAPACK. The compiled code of BLAS/LAPACK corrupts stack, often resulting in crashes. This impacts R, R packages directly calling into BLAS/LAPACK, and all other applications of BLAS/LAPACK. The work-around is to compile BLAS/LAPACK with -fno-optimize-sibling-calls. This option is now used in R-Devel and R-Patched, so that the reference BLAS and LAPACK included in R are compiled with that option.</description>
