      <description>The R graphics engine performs some clipping of output regardless of whether the graphics device it is sending output to can perform clipping itself. For example, output that is sent to the postscript() device, which can do its own clipping, is still clipped by the graphics engine to the edges of the device.
This is useful for devices that cannot clip, e.g., the xfig() device, and was historically useful as protection against very large values being sent to a device.</description>
