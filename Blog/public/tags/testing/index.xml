      <description>If you use R you may have wondered if there are ways you can contribute to making R better. This is another post on how you might help (Reviewing Bug Reports was the first).
This post is about helping with testing of pre-release versions of R.
Maintaining and improving R unavoidably comes with introducing regressions, that is breaking things which worked before. This also happens when external software changes its behavior (OS, compilers, libraries).</description>

      <description>At WWDC 2020 earlier this year, Apple announced a transition from Intel to ARM-based processors in their laptops. This blog is about the prospects of when R will work on that platform, based on experimentation on a developer machine running A12Z, one of the “Apple silicon” processors.
The new platform will include Rosetta 2, a dynamic translation framework which runs binaries built for 64-bit Intel Macs using just-in-time, dynamic translation of binary code.</description>
