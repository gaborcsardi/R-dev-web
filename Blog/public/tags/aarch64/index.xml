      <description>At WWDC 2020 earlier this year, Apple announced a transition from Intel to ARM-based processors in their laptops. This blog is about the prospects of when R will work on that platform, based on experimentation on a developer machine running A12Z, one of the “Apple silicon” processors.
The new platform will include Rosetta 2, a dynamic translation framework which runs binaries built for 64-bit Intel Macs using just-in-time, dynamic translation of binary code.</description>

      <description>Sometimes it is useful to test R on unusual platforms, even when the expected number of users is not large at the moment. It is better to be ready when a new platform arrives or becomes more widely used, it may be easier to find some bugs on one platform than other, and such testing may reveal code unintentionally too platform specific.
Recently I wanted to test R on 64-bit ARM (Aarch64) and on Power.</description>
