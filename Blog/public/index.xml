      <description>Some packages contain native code, which is linked to R dynamically in the form of dynamically loaded libraries (DLLs). Recently, R users started loading increasing numbers of packages; “workflow documents” are one source of this pattern. This has eventually lead to hitting the DLL limit in R, which materializes as runtime error “maximal number of DLLs reached”.
Limit on the number of open files The DLL limit in R is good for one important reason.</description>

      <title>A Plain Markdown Post</title>

      <description>This is a post written in plain Markdown (*.md) instead of R Markdown (*.Rmd). The major differences are:
 You cannot run any R code in a plain Markdown document, whereas in an R Markdown document, you can embed R code chunks (```{r}); A plain Markdown post is rendered through Blackfriday, and an R Markdown document is compiled by rmarkdown and Pandoc.  There are many differences in syntax between Blackfriday&amp;rsquo;s Markdown and Pandoc&amp;rsquo;s Markdown.</description>
