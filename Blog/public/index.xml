      <description>Historically R language allows conditions in if and while statements to be vectors (of length greater than one). The first element is used but the remaining elements are ignored, since November 2002 also with a warning (added by Brian Ripley). Following an intuition that such situations would typically arise from a programming error, an option has been added in March 2017 to optionally allow signalling a runtime error, instead (the patch was by Martin Maechler, pinged by a suggestion of Henrik Bengtsson on the R-devel mailing list).</description>

      <title>Maximum Number of DLLs</title>

      <description>Some packages contain native code, which is linked to R dynamically in the form of dynamically loaded libraries (DLLs). Recently, R users started loading increasing numbers of packages; “workflow documents” are one source of this pattern. This has eventually lead to hitting the DLL limit in R, which materializes as runtime error “maximal number of DLLs reached”.
Limit on the number of open files The DLL limit in R is good for one important reason.</description>

      <description>On this blogging site R developers share their experience, ideas and plans related to R core implementation. Technical details presented here might be useful for package developers and interesting for technically-minded R enthusiasts.
The blog posts represent individual opinions of their authors. Unless stated so explicitly, they should not be taken as positions of R Core nor R Foundation.
In the interest of technical quality of the posts, the authors may modify existing posts after publication.</description>
