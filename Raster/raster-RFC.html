<h3>Background</h3>

<p>
It has been possible for some time
to read bitmap images into R and draw them, 
via packages 'pixmap' and 'EBImage' (BioConductor).  However, because R's 
graphics engine has only had vector drawing primitives, drawing  raster images
via those packages
is performed by drawing a tiny rectangle for each pixel in the 
original image.  This has two major problems:  no interpolation 
occurs if the rendered size differs from the natural raster size of the
image <em>and</em> when this sort of output is produced in a text-based
format such as PostScript or PDF, the file size can get out of control.

<h3>Recent Changes</h3>

<p>
Support has been added to the graphics engine for rendering
raster images to graphics devices, via a 
GE_Raster(image, x, y, width, height, angle) function
(with grid.raster() at the user level).

<p>
In addition, for reasons explained below, there is support
for <em>capturing</em> raster images from graphics devices, via
a GE_Cap() function (with grid.cap() at the user level).

<h3>Issues</h3>

<ol>
<li>
The support for drawing raster images varies quite a lot between devices.
<p>
For example, the 'graphapp' library that we use for drawing
on Windows only seems to provide support for scaling images
(scale_image()),
but not for rotating them, <em>and</em> it only seems to support
full transparency, not semi-transparency.  
<p>
The raw X11 device
(with no extensions)
does not even have support for scaling images!  (There is some 
image rotation and scaling code in src/modules/X11/rotation.c,
but it is quite tightly focused on providing support for
rotating text.)  
<p>
XFig is a strange one where, from memory, the main file
refers to an external file containing the image.

</ol>

<h3>Solutions</h3>

<ol>
<li>
Support has been added to the graphics engine to allow scaling 
(nearest-neighbour), interpolation (bilinear), and rotation
of raster images.

<p>
Devices can make use of these if they cannot perform the 
relevant operations themselves.  For example, the X11
device and the Windows device make use of all three.

</ol>

<h3>Applications</h3>

<p>
With raster support you get the possibility of smaller PDF files
when you draw a raster image to a PDF device and you get interpolation
of raster images that are drawn by R, as described in the original
motivation.

<p>
You also get the ability to address individual pixels in
a raster image, which is useful for things like producing
HTML image maps(?)

<p>
You also get encouraged to play with raster images in R, for example,
generating simple things like colour gradients for filling
bars in barplots, or fake-3D bullet points for plotting symbols
(plus, you can generate any gradient that you like because
you can generate any matrix that you like!).

<p>
With the GE_Cap(), you also can do some interesting things like
drawing vector output to a screen device (which rasterizes it,
possibly including antialiasing), then reading that image back into R
and doing fun things like using it as a mask on a gradient fill
(e.g., filling text with a gradient fill).  This might be a
really good way to generate some wild gradients too(?)

<p>
<a href="textGradient.R"><img src="textGradient.png"></a>

<p>
All of those, along with the ability to arrange raster images
using R's layout facilities, means that you start to think
of R as a playground for raster image manipulation.  Probably
a slow one, but possibly a more convenient one to work in
if you're used to R, but not so used to things like 
ImageMagick.

<p>
* Rotation of raster images in the graphics engine introduces 
pixels from outside the original image
in the "new" regions of the rotated image and  the colour of these
pixels is taken from gc->fill.  This is not so bad on Windows
because the background can be set to "transparent" so that these
introduced regions are invisible (though there will typically still
be some artifacts at the edges of the rotated image because
the Windows device does not support a smooth alpha channel).  On
the X11 device, things are worse because images must be opaque,
so the best you can do is to set gc->fill to match the background.

<p>
** The Windows device can do semitransparent raster images, but ONLY
if there is a constant alpha across the entire image, i.e., it CANNOT
do per-pixel alpha (the Windows API AlphaBlend can, but GraphApp's
bitmap structures do not support "shades of alpha" - it's either
transparent or opaque).  The Windows device DOES support fully 
transparent pixels in an image (possibly in addition to a single
level of semitransparency).  In other words, the image can have up to three 
different levels of alpha, as long as fully transparent and fully opaque
are two of the three.

<p>
*** The PostScript device can only cope with small raster images
(less than about 10K pixels, e.g., 100x100).  NOTE that this
device also relies on the graphics engine for interpolation
(currently only to 72 dpi),
which may radically increase the number of pixels in the image.
On the other hand, interpolating to only 72 dpi may DECREASE
the number of pixels for a high-res image drawn small.

NYI (Not Yet Implemented)

<p>
NRI (No Real Intention to implement) means that there is no
plan in the immediate future to attempt to implement this feature 
for this device.

<p>
NA (Not Applicable) means that it is not possible to support this feature on
this device.
