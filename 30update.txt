Updating packages for 3.0.0
===========================

Package maintainers should be aware of the following changes scheduled
to appear in 3.0.0 on March/April 2013

Long vectors
============

On 64-bit platforms, the length of a vector is no longer limited to
2^31-1.   This applies to matrices and arrays, but for the time being
their dimensions are limited to 2^31-1.

The most important consequence is that length(x) is now more likely to
not be an integer.  (This has always been a possibility for methods,
and e.g. package Matrix had methods that return a double.)
Programmers have frequently assumed that lengths were integers when
passing to .C/.Fortran, and furthermore that as.integer(length(x)) was
not NA.  So safe code will

- always use as.integer(length(x)) when calling .C/.Fortran
- if using NAOK = TRUE, check that the result is not NA.

As a precaution, .C and .Fortran do not accept long vectors (as a
common idiom is to pass a vector and its length).
