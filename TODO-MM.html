<h3>Shorter term </h3>
<!-- ----------------------------------- -->

<ul>
<li> Improve  pair()  to allow spreading over a few pages
     ("wall paper" :-)  {a bit as <tt>lag.plot()</tt> (from the
     <tt>ts</tt> package) does}.

<li> plot.factor() should  *not* do boxplots by default when
     the boxplot contains less than or only about 5-7 observations!
<li> The dendrogram class {package "mva"} needs better and more versatile
     methods,  particularly plot.*().  <br>
     One application is for the  <A
     HREF="http://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/PACKAGES.html#VLMC">
     VLMC </A> package available from <A
     HREF="http://cran.r-project.org">CRAN</A>.  Here, do
     as.dendrogram.VLMC() properly and implement plot.VLMC() basically
     doing plot.dendrogram( as.dendrogram.VLMC( * ) ).

<li> Minimum Spanning Tree: two versions (maybe in one function):<br>
<ol>
<li> mstree() using <em>Euclidean</em> distance and the usual n x p data
     matrix.  Robert has a simple <tt>mstree()</tt> in his unofficial
     Genecluster package in bioconductor {though lacking Friedman/Rafsky's
     planing option}  which should be easy to put into mva as is.
<li> I really want to compute the general MST problem (i.e. given an
     arbitrary graph with weighted edges, find a subgraph which is a tree
     with minimal edge weight sum).  The typical application I have in mind
     would still be graphs with many edges, i.e. <em>almost complete</em>
     ones.
</ol>
</ul>


<h3> Of less priority </h3>
<!-- ----------------------------------- -->
<ul>
<li>
  <A HREF="http://www.statistik.uni-dortmund.de/leute/ligges/R/scatterplot3d/">
    scatterplot3d</A> from Uwe Ligges): A simple 3D scatterplot with somewhat
  <i>orthogonal functionality</i> to persp().

<li> Need C API for the Median() and more generally  quantile(x, alpha).
    <em><font=-1> (not sure anymore; we have a C API to partial sorting)
        </font>
     </em>
<li> Running Medians for library(modreg) :
  We need a fast robust smoother; <tt>lowess()</tt> is <em>not</em> robust.
    <em><font=-1> (a non-release of a package "runmed" is available;
    need to write a short paper on what I found ....) </font> </em>

<li> <tt>stem()</tt> should exclude outliers and list them separately
  (as S does).

<li> New print option for printing exact "0"s:<br>
    Consider using <tt>"."</tt> instead of <tt>"0"</tt> in numerical
    matrices. This would make sparse matrices much more readable.
    <small>[I have been doing this with S-plus for years.]</small>

<li> scat1d() {improved rug(); the thing I've co-authored and has then
	       been put into Hmisc}.

</ul>

<h3> Even Longer Term </h3>
<!-- ----------------------------------- -->
<ul>

<li> Differential Equation Solvers; I need a boundary value problem solver,
    additional to the LSODA functionality of the very good
  <A HREF="http://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/PACKAGES.html#odesolve">
  odesolve </A> package available from
  <A HREF="http://cran.r-project.org">CRAN</A>.
</ul>
