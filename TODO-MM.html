<h3>Shorter term, maybe for R 1.1.x </h3>
<!-- ----------------------------------- -->

<ul>
<li> Implement Clive Loader's  dbinom(), dpois() improvements.

<li> Replace qnorm()'s algorithm with AS 241.
  <br>
  I've been considering an option which would allow to use the old
  (quite less precise, but a tad faster) version.
  Some of this idea, I started to discuss in Vienna..
  <br>
  This would <em>not</em> be a new argument to qnorm(), but rather a global
  thing in options(..), something like
  <pre>
	      options(prob.precision = 1e-10) # 1e-10 is somewhat arbitrary.
	      options(dpq.precision  = 1e-10)
  </pre>
  which would use faster less precise algorithms when the required
  precision was set high (i.e., 1e-4 instead of 1e-10).
  <P>

  Feedback?  Not worth the hassle?
</ul>


<h3> Of less priority, some AFTER 1.1.x </h3>
<!-- ----------------------------------- -->
<ul>
<li>
  <A HREF="http://www.statistik.uni-dortmund.de/leute/ligges/R/scatterplot3d/">
    scatterplot3d</A> from Uwe Ligges): A simple 3D scatterplot with somewhat
  <i>orthogonal functionality</i> to persp().

<li>   Running Medians for library(modreg) :
  We need a fast robust smoother; <t>lowess()</t> is <em>not</em> robust.

<li> New print option for printing exact "0"s.
    Consider using "." instead of "0" in numerical matrices which makes
    sparse matrices much more readable. <br>

    <small>[I have been doing this with S-plus for years]</small>

<li> scat1d()  {improved rug(); the thing I've co-authored which has now
	       been put into  Hmisc}.

<li> stem() should exclude outliers and list them separately (as S does).
</ul>

<h3> Even Longer Term </h3>
<!-- ----------------------------------- -->
<ul>

<li> Numerical Integration.<br>

I want to have something as good as Quadpack.
  <A HREF="http://sourceware.cygnus.com/gsl/">
    GSL -- The GNU Scientific Library</A>
  seems the place to tap for these things, and I have had a
  first successful dyn.load() working with (part of) it.

<li> Differential Equation Solvers (ODE at least), also using GSL (see above).
</ul>
