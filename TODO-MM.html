<h2>Shorter term, maybe for R 1.1.x </h2>

<ul>
<li> Implement  Cloader's  dbinom(), dpois() improvements

<li> Replace  qnorm()'s algorithm with AS 241.

  I've been considering an option which would allow to use the old
  (quite less precise, but a tad faster) version.
  Some of this idea, I started to discuss in Vienna..

  This would *not* be a new argument to qnorm(), but rather a global
  thing in options(..), something like
  <pre>
	      options(prob.precision = 1e-10) # 1e-10 is somewhat arbitrary.
	      options(dpq.precision  = 1e-10)
  </pre>
  which would use faster less precise algorithms when the required
  precision was set high (i.e., 1e-4 instead of 1e-10)


  Feedback?  Not worth the hassle?
</ul>


<h2> Of less priority, some AFTER 1.1.x </h2>

<ul>
<li>  (with Uwe Ligges):  scatterplot3d(.)

<li>   Running Medians for library(modreg) :
  We need a fast robust smoother; <t>lowess()</t> is <em>not</em> robust}

<li>   new  print option for printing exact "0"s.
    Consider using "." instead of "0" in numerical matrices

    [I have been doing this with S-plus for years]

<li>   scat1d()  {improved rug(); the thing I've co-authored which has now
	       been put into  Hmisc}.

<li>   stem() should exclude outliers and list them separately (as S does).
</ul>
