<h3>Shorter term </h3>
<!-- ----------------------------------- -->

<ul>
<li> Improve  pair()  to allow spreading over a few pages
     ("wall paper" :-)  {a bit as <tt>lag.plot()</tt> (from the
     <tt>ts</tt> package) does}.

     Improve it along the lines of Catherine Hurley  (even much easier)

<li> plot.factor() should  *not* do boxplots by default when
     the boxplot contains less than or only about 5-7 observations!

<li> Extend  box() to also accept 'bg' and draw backgrounds using GRect().
     box(bg="green3") will then be a higher level alternative to
     (code from <tt>demo(graphics)</tt>!)
     <pre>
     usr <- par("usr")
     rect(usr[1], usr[3], usr[2], usr[4], col="green3")
     box()
     </pre>


<li> The dendrogram class {package "stats"} needs better and more versatile
     methods,  particularly plot.*().  <br>
     One application is for the  <A
     HREF="http://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/PACKAGES.html#VLMC">
     VLMC </A> package available from <A
     HREF="http://cran.r-project.org">CRAN</A>.  Here, do
     as.dendrogram.VLMC() properly and implement plot.VLMC() basically
     doing plot.dendrogram( as.dendrogram.VLMC( * ) ).
     <br> <em>(done in parts for R 1.9.0; more todo)</em>

<li> Minimum Spanning Tree: two versions (maybe in one function):<br>
  <ol> <!--- `Enumerate' : -->
  <li> mstree() using <em>Euclidean</em> distance and the usual n x p data
       matrix.  Robert has a simple <tt>mstree()</tt> in his unofficial
       Genecluster package in bioconductor {though lacking Friedman/Rafsky's
       planing option}  which should be easy to put into 'stats' as is.
  <li> I really want to compute the general MST problem (i.e. given an
       arbitrary graph with weighted edges, find a subgraph which is a tree
       with minimal edge weight sum).  The typical application I have in mind
       would still be graphs with many edges, i.e. <em>almost complete</em> ones.
  </ol>


<li> procrustes() is wanted, but not just the two sample case,
     and (eventually at least) also with case and variable weighting.

<li> Extend the <A HREF="http:Rds.html">Guidelines for Rd files</A>,
     (say more about <tt>\item</tt> in <tt>\arguments</tt>,
      also recommendation/examples about the usage of <tt>\describe</tt>)
     and think about merging (or moving) parts into the
     <em> Writing R Extensions </em> manual which is part of R, or
     available from the
      <A HREF="http:///CRAN.R-project.org/manuals.html">CRAN Manuals</A>.

<li>  cov.wt() should also work with NA's, with a `use' argument identical
      to  cov(), cor();
      Using a notion of "generalized ranks", maybe could also grow  "spearman"
      and "kendall" methods.
</ul>


<h3> Of less priority </h3>
<!-- ----------------------------------- -->
<ul>

<li> Need C API for the Median() and more generally  quantile(x, alpha).
    <em><font=-1> (not sure anymore; we have a C API to partial sorting)
        </font>
     </em>
<li> <tt>stem()</tt> should exclude outliers and list them separately
  (as S does).

<li> New print option for printing exact "0"s:<br>
    Consider using <tt>"."</tt> instead of <tt>"0"</tt> in numerical
    matrices. This would make sparse matrices much more readable.
    <small>[I have been doing this with S-plus for years.]</small>

<li> scat1d() {improved rug(); the thing I've co-authored and has then
	       been put into Hmisc}.

</ul>

<h3> Even Longer Term </h3>
<!-- ----------------------------------- -->
<ul>

<li> Differential Equation Solvers; I need a boundary value problem solver,
    additional to the LSODA functionality of the very good
  <A HREF="http://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/PACKAGES.html#odesolve">
  odesolve </A> package available from
  <A HREF="http://cran.r-project.org">CRAN</A>.
</ul>
