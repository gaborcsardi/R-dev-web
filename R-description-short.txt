`GNU S' - A language and environment for statistical computing and
graphics.  R is described by its authors as "not unlike" S, which is a
language developed at Bell Laboratories.  It provides support for a
wide variety of statistical and graphical analyses (linear and
nonlinear modelling, statistical tests, time series analysis,
classification, clustering, ...). In addition R is a true computer
language which contains a number of control-flow constructions for
iteration and alternation.  It allows users to add additional
functionality by defining new functions.  Fortran and C code can be
linked and called at run time.
