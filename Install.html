<h1>Changes to INSTALL and installation procedure</h1>

The following are some proposed changes to the procedure for
installing packages.

<h3>Loading a Package from an Image File</h3>

An option has been added to the <code>INSTALL</code> script to create
an image of the package at install time. This image is loaded when the corresponding library
      is attached, <i>instead</i> of parsing and evaluating the
source.<p>

There are several reasons to need this.

      <ul>
	<li> Semantics.<p>

	    If the package source does some computation <i>other</i> than just
assigning functions, it may be difficult or impossible to get the
	    desired effect through the form of parse-eval used when
	    the library is attached.
	    <p>
	    For example, the <code>RSMethods</code> package and all
	    packages that use it will need to define formal classes
	    and methods and save the resulting objects in the
	    package. By definition, these computations default to save the results in
	    the global environment (where=1).  It is possible to trick
	    the computations
	    to save the results in the package's environment, but  the
	    mechanism needed is messy and unintuitive, and not something we
	    want to pass on to future contributors. (Packages
	    <code>RSMethods</code> and <code>OOP</code> in the
	    Omegahat collection are examples of how it can be done.)<p>
	<li> Efficiency.<p>
	    The special computations needed for installing some of the newer
	    packages can take considerable time.  This is true of the
	    <code>RSMethods</code> example and of some of the
	    inter-system interface packages.
	    When we embed R in other systems, startup
	    time becomes a more serious issue.  Even for conventional,
	    but large, packages, startup time can be nontrivial.
	 </ul>
	 <p>
The proposed, optional alternative works as follows.
	 <ol>
	   <li> At install time, the package source is run through R
	       in batch mode, and the resulting image file is saved.
	   <li> When the library is attached, an automatically
	       generated version of
	       <code>.First.lib</code> loads the image and then
	       invokes  the actual <code>.First.lib</code> from the package, if any.
	 </ol>
<p>
This version of installation can be triggered either by an option
	 (<code>-s</code> or <code>--save</code>) to the
	 <code>INSTALL</code> command, or by the presence of a file
	 <code>INSTALL.R</code> in the package directory.  (Because
	 some packages may require installation this way, we need a
	 package-specific mechanism to trigger it.  The command option
	 <code>--no-save</code> overrides the <code>INSTALL.R</code> file.)<p>
	 If the <code>INSTALL.R</code> file is empty, its
	 presence causes the version of <code>.First.lib</code>
	 mentioned above to be copied to the installed package
	 source.  If the file is non-empty, its contents are copied
	 instead, allowing the package designer to customize the
	 installation procedure  (so far, no example requiring this has come up).
	 <p>
The procedure of saving and loading an image of the package objects
	 should be compatible with the standard installation for
	 objects assigned directly in the source.  If the package
	 source does something with strictly session scope, this would
	 need to be done in the <code>.First.lib</code> with the new
	 installation.  One likely example is requiring other
	 packages: the calls to <code>require</code> need to be done
	 from <code>.First.lib</code>.
	 <p>
The environment variable <code>R_SAVE_IMAGE</code> is set to
	 <code>true</code> and can be used by the package code to take
	 different action when the code is being run to create a
	 loadable image.
Two examples of packages set up for optional installation in this form
	 are in the Omegahat packages download area:  the <a
	 href="http://www.omegahat.org/RSMethods/">RSMethods</a>
	 package, and the (unadvertised but
	 available) <a href="http://www.omegahat.org/RSOOP/">OOP</a>
	 package for object-oriented programming.
<p>
For the proposed changes, see the <a href="INSTALL">INSTALL</a>
	 script and the <a href="INSTALL.diff">diff's</a> against the current version.
