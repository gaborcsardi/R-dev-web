<h1>CVS Techniques</h1> 

<i>This info is for reference to the core developers. Use of anonymous
CVS for outsiders is not yet covered here, but may be in the
future.</i>

<h3>Preliminaries</h3>

<p> There are three main development branches for R, corresponding
to the three components of the version number. For reference, we call
them  <tt>r-ng</tt> (next generation), <tt>r-devel</tt>, and
<tt>r-patched</tt>. 

<p>After the release of R-x.y.z the three versions
working towards
<pre><kbd>
Version      Name            Tag
-----------------------------------------
R-(x+1).0.0  r-ng            R-x+1-pre
R-x.(y+1).0  r-devel         [none]
R-x.y.(z+1)  r-patched       R-x-y-patches
</kbd></pre> 

The "Tag" column refers to CVS branch tags. The logic is that patch
releases (R-x.y.z, z!=0) are made from the branch tagged
"R-x-y-patches", whereas normal releases (R-x.y.0) are made from the
from the "trunk" i.e. the untagged files.

<p> New major versions (R-x.0.0) are also made from the trunk, but in
order to allow large changes to be properly developed, tested, and
debugged, we prepare the new generation on a branch separate from the
normal release schedule and will fold the changes back when preparing
for the actual release.

<p> In what follows, I shall use the reference names also as directory
names. All developers are encouraged to use the same names, to provide
us with a common reference.

<h3>Checking out a development branch</h3>

<p> (By a development branch, I mean either the trunk or a version
marked by a CVS branc tag)

<p> First set the CVSROOT environment variable and make sure it is
exported:<br>

For <tt>sh </tt>variants, use

<p>
<tt>CVSROOT=cvs.r-project.org:/home/rdevel/CVS-ARCHIVE</tt><br>
<tt>export CVSROOT</tt><p>

For <tt>csh </tt>and derivatives, use

<p> 
<tt>setenv CVSROOT cvs.r-project.org:/home/rdevel/CVS-ARCHIVE</tt>

<p>
Also make sure that you have <tt>CVS_RSH </tt>set to ssh. I shall
assume the <tt>bash</tt> shell in the following, for simplicity, and
create the three development directories under $RTOP.

<pre><kbd>
export RTOP=~/R-devel #adjust as necessary
</kbd></pre>


<h4>The head revision</h4>
(aka "r-devel")
<pre><kbd>
mkdir -p $RTOP/r-devel
cd $RTOP/r-devel
cvs co -P R 
</kbd></pre>

<p>
The <tt>-P</tt> option prunes empty directories. The checked out
directory will be called "R". Use the <tt>-d</tt> option to call it
something else.


<h4> Current patch branch</h4> 
(aka "r-patched")
<pre><kbd>
mkdir -p $RTOP/r-patched
cd $RTOP/r-patched
cvs co -P -r R-1-3-patches R
</kbd></pre>


<h4> Current next-generation branch</h4> 
(aka "r-ng")

<pre><kbd>
mkdir -p $RTOP/r-ng
cd $RTOP/r-ng
cvs co -P -r R-2-pre R
</kbd></pre>

<p> Notice that this gives you an "R" subdirectory within
r-devel/r-patched/r-ng. I find this useful so that I can have a
parallel BUILD directory for each revision. However, it is also
possible to avoid the extra directory layer with e.g.

<pre><kbd>
cd $RTOP
cvs co -P -d r-ng -r R-2-pre R
</kbd></pre>


<h3>Checking out a specific release version</h3> 

Release versions are labeled with a tag of the form R-1-2-3. (For
obscure reasons, non-patch versions up to R-1.3.0 were labeled R-1-3
and not R-1-3-0. This will be changed starting with R-1.4.0.). You can
check out an old version simply with

<p>
<tt>cvs co -P -r R-1-2-3 R</tt>

<p>Notice however, that these tags are not branch tags, you cannot change
a released version and commit the changes back.

<h3>Updating</h3>

To update a source tree with the latest changes, just go to the
relevant top-level directory (e.g. $RTOP/r-patches/R) and say

<p>
<tt>cvs up -Pd</tt>

<p>If you want to make completely sure that the files come from a
given branch, add (say) <tt> -r R-1-3-patches </tt>. I am unsure
whether (and when) this is actually needed; there seems have been a
case where a new directory got added from the wrong branch.

<p>If you are on a slow connection, it generally works to take one
revision and convert it to another tagged revision by using e.g.
<p>
<tt>cvs up -Pd -r R-1-3-patches</tt>
<p>To create the trunk revision from a branch revision, use
<p>
<tt>cvs up -PdA</tt>
<p> Notice, however, that CVS is capable of getting things wrong,
notably if interrupted in the middle of an update. This can lead to an
infinite loop condition when updating. If that happens, I know no
remedy other that doing a fresh checkout instead.

<h3>Committing</h3>
To put your modified versions back in the repository, just say

<tt>cvs commit -m'describe change' FILE1 FILE2 ...</tt>

<p>or just

<p>
<tt>cvs commit</tt>

<p>in which case you'll be asked for a change comment. 

<p>Notice that commits only works on the trunk and on branch
revisions. Non-branch tags represent the status of the files at a
given instance in the past which is unchangeable by definition.


<h3> Updating from r-patched to r-devel, entire tree</h3>

<pre><kbd>
	# assumes that 	"last-patch-update" is set correctly

export RTOP=~/R-devel #adjust as necessary
export TAG=R-1-3-patches

cd $RTOP/r-devel/R
cvs rtag -F -r $TAG  patch-update R

cvs update -Pd
cvs update -Pd -j last-patch-update  -j patch-update
find -type f | xargs grep '>>>>>>>'
	# fix conflicts...
cvs commit -m 'branch update'

	# better do this right away...
cvs rtag -F -r patch-update last-patch-update R

</kbd></pre>

<h3> Updating patches from r-patched to r-devel, specific files</h3>

<pre><kbd>

FILES="src/main/unique.c NEWS" #change to your liking
PATCH=~/R-devel/r-patched/R         #ditto
DEVEL=~/R-devel/r-devel/R     #ditto

# fix and commit to r-patched  as usual, e.g.
cd $PATCH
cvs up
vi $FILES
#----------
# TEST your CHANGES
#---------
cvs commit $FILES

# Note: Use cvs tag (not rtag) just in case someone commited a change
# in the meantime
cvs tag -F patch-update $FILES

cd $DEVEL

cvs update -j last-patch-update  -j patch-update $FILES
grep '>>>>>>>' $FILES
#------------
# FIX CONFLICTS (if any)
# This technique is often helpful, although you need to be aware that 
# ediff occasionally makes conflicts more complicated rather than
# less...
#
#   emacs <filename> -f vc-resolve-conflicts
#------------
cvs commit -m 'branch update' $FILES
cvs rtag -F -r patch-update last-patch-update $FILES

</kbd></pre>

<h3> Handling experimental branches </h3>

<pre><kbd>
Suppose you want to have a branch to hold your volatile changes, let's
say R-Tk.

(A) Creating the branch
    ===================

CVSROOT=cvs.r-project.org:/home/rdevel/CVS-ARCHIVE</tt><br>
export CVSROOT

cvs rtag -b R-Tk R
mkdir r-experimental
cd r-experimental
cvs checkout -P -r R-Tk R
cvs rtag -r R-Tk R-Tk-update-last R

(B) Hacking on the branch
    =====================

Just like on the release branch:

cvs update -Pd -r R-Tk
#..hack, hack, hack....
cvs commit -m'hacked blah' 

(C) Updating from r-devel (aka "main trunk")
    ========================================

cvs rtag -F R-Tk-update R
cvs update -Pd -j R-Tk-update-last -j R-Tk-update 
# resolve conflicts if any
cvs commit -m 'merged from main'
cvs rtag -F -r R-Tk-update R-Tk-update-last R

(D) Merging the hack back into r-devel
    ==================================

cd ~/r-devel/R 
cvs update -Pd -j R-Tk # resolve conflicts if any
cvs commit -m'merged with Tk branch'
